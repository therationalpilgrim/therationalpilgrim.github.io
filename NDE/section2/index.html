Although positive accounts are by far the most common, there are disturbing testimonies of so-called “negative” NDEs, involving feelings of anguish, isolation, or even damnation. The book <em>Life After Death – Why We Should Believe</em> briefly addresses this topic, citing several studies (Greyson, Bush, Moody).</p><p>The authors (Chambon and Riffard) point out that:</p><ul><li>These experiences are very rare (1–5% of cases depending on sources).</li><li>They are less often shared because they are shameful, traumatic, or poorly understood.</li><li>They should not be interpreted as punishments, but rather as reflections of the psychological state at the moment of death (fear, resistance, confusion).</li><li>Sometimes, these NDEs begin in darkness but evolve toward the light after a moment of letting go.</li></ul><p>They may therefore be understood not as spiritual failures, but as initiatory stages—calls to inner transformation.</p><p>To better understand them, here are two representative testimonies: that of Nancy Evans Bush (the void) and that of Howard Storm (hell).</p><hr><h3 id=nancy-evans-bush-the-existential-void>Nancy Evans Bush: the existential void

Unlike the luminous accounts, she experienced an absolute void: no identity, no God, no reference points. A cold, endless nothingness.</p><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>I was in the void. And I was… nothing. Forgotten, nonexistent.</blockquote></figure><p>She describes total annihilation—no fire, no demons, but a radical absence of everything. This experience haunted her for years. For more than 20 years, she told no one about it, fearing she would be seen as insane or isolated.</p></div><div style=flex:1;min-width:250px><figure style=margin:0;padding:0;display:inline-block><img src=https://therationalpilgrim.com/images/nancy-bush.jpg alt="Nancy Bush" style=max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;display:block><figcaption style=font-style:italic;font-size:.7em;text-align:right>https://ndestories.org/nancy-evans-bush/</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>It was only much later, when she discovered the work of Raymond Moody and the IANDS (International Association for Near-Death Studies), that she realized she was not alone. She learned that others had also experienced “dark” NDEs, and she then decided to conduct her own research.</p><p>With the support of Dr. Bruce Greyson, she explored these minority accounts and became the voice of those who had never been heard: witnesses of negative NDEs.</p><p>Their profiles are often far from stereotypes:</p><ul><li>some are moral, religious, or compassionate individuals;</li><li>others are very rational, attached to control, or going through an unconscious inner crisis.</li></ul><p>What they seem to share is a form of inner disconnection: fear of letting go, mental rigidity, emotional emptiness.</p><p>These experiences may be understood as a form of purification or spiritual crisis:</p><ul><li>they confront the soul with its lack of love or meaning;</li><li>they force the letting go of false certainties;</li><li>they trigger a deep inner transformation.</li></ul><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>Hell may not be a place. It may be a stage—a violent transition that pushes us to let go.</blockquote></figure><p>In her book <em>Dancing Past the Dark</em>, she identifies three types of negative NDEs:</p><ul><li>the inverse: the light becomes threatening;</li><li>the void: total nothingness;</li><li>hell: visions of fire, screams, dark entities.</li></ul><p>She insists: these experiences are never final. They are passages, not condemnations.</p><p>📘 <em>Dancing Past the Dark: Distressing Near-Death Experiences</em>, Nancy Evans Bush, Hampton Roads Publishing, 2012 (rev. ed. 2020)<br>🎥

I was convinced that nothing existed after death. Only naïve people believed in that sort of thing. I believed in neither God, nor heaven, nor hell, nor any of those fairy tales.</blockquote></figure><p>But in 1985, during a trip to Paris, he suffered a severe intestinal perforation. While awaiting emergency surgery, he lost consciousness and underwent a profoundly disturbing near-death experience.</p></div><div style=flex:1;min-width:250px><figure style=margin:0;padding:0;display:inline-block><img src=https://therationalpilgrim.com/images/Howard_Storm_(2016).png alt="Howard Storm" style=max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;display:block><figcaption style=font-style:italic;font-size:.7em;text-align:right>http://www.howardstorm.com</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>He found himself outside his body, guided by entities through a dark corridor. These beings quickly became hostile and violent. He experienced a scene of hell: solitude, humiliation, psychological suffering. Deep within himself, a voice urged him to pray—again and again. He tried to recall childhood memories from Sunday school or fragments of prayers he had learned, or anything even remotely similar, such as “God Bless America.” This had an effect. The entities retreated.</p><p>Alone, on the edge of despair, he called out to Jesus for help:</p><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>For the first time in my adult life, I wanted Jesus to be real. I didn’t know how to pray or what to say, but with all the strength I had left, I cried out, “Jesus, please save me.”</blockquote></figure><p>Immediately, a gentle, loving light burst forth and pulled him out of the darkness. He was welcomed by a presence of peace and love, which he identified as Jesus. This experience of love completely transformed him.</p><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>I knew, with absolute certainty, that God loved me.</blockquote></figure><p>He asked many questions and received clear answers. Jesus gave him guidance and wisdom:</p><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>You will find what you are looking for. If you are looking for love, you will find love. If you are looking for hate, you will find hate. What you are within yourself will be reflected back to you.</blockquote></figure><p>When he begged to remain in this light, God replied:</p><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>You are not ready to come here yet. You still have things to learn, and you still have work to do in the world.</blockquote></figure><p>Upon returning to life, he was radically transformed: he left academia, became a Christian, and then a pastor. He devoted his life to sharing this message: love is the purpose of existence, and even at the depths of hell, one can still call out to the light.</p><p>📘 <em>My Descent Into Death: A Second Chance at Life</em>, Howard Storm, Hampton Roads Publishing, 2000<br>🎥
