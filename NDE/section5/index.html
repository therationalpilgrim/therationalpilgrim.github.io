The books by Raymond Moody, as well as the french book &ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire&rdquo; (i.e. Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed) by Olivier Chambon and Marie-Odile Riffard, profoundly transformed my perception of death.
These works led me to question the idea—deeply rooted in my traditional Christian upbringing—that death would be a final judgment, permanently sealing our fate. On the contrary, the testimonies they compile suggest that death is a transition to another plane of existence, where consciousness survives and where the soul can continue to evolve and grow spiritually."><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section5/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="The Rational Pilgrim"><meta property="og:title" content="What Happens After Death? – Conclusions"><meta property="og:description" content="6.5 Conclusions The books by Raymond Moody, as well as the french book “La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire” (i.e. Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed) by Olivier Chambon and Marie-Odile Riffard, profoundly transformed my perception of death.

On the contrary, the testimonies they compile suggest that death is a transition to another plane of existence, where consciousness survives and where the soul can continue to evolve and grow spiritually.</p><p>One striking element of many near-death experiences is the life review: individuals relive their entire existence, often through the eyes of others—feeling the emotions they themselves caused through their words and actions. This process is not punitive. It is a profound awakening, intended to foster learning and inner transformation.</p><p>Howard Storm’s testimony particularly moved me. He recounts that after having rejected God throughout his life, he found himself—following clinical death—immersed in a distressing darkness. And yet, God did not impose Himself upon him. He respected that refusal to the very end. But He also offered a way out: an inner voice gently encouraged him to pray. This simple act of openness changed everything—he was rescued and guided toward a light of unconditional love.</p><p>Some accounts of negative near-death experiences describe states of suffering: isolation, anguish, darkness, sometimes even fire, pain, and dark entities. However, these trials seem less like condemnations than initiatory passages designed to provoke a radical awakening—a call to inner conversion.</p><p>Many witnesses also report encountering a being of light, an angel, a spiritual guide, or even Jesus himself. These encounters are described as overwhelming, suffused with absolute love, and often accompanied by spiritual revelations. The main messages that recur insistently are:</p><ul><li><strong>You are deeply loved</strong>: Each person is welcomed by a divine presence (light, Jesus, God) who loves them unconditionally, without judgment or condemnation.</li><li><strong>The purpose of life is to love and to serve</strong>: Earthly life is an opportunity to learn to love others and to contribute to the common good through service.</li><li><strong>Earth is a spiritual school</strong>: Life—and even suffering—aims to help the soul evolve, and this process continues after death in other planes of existence.</li></ul><p>One striking fact stands out: none of the testimonies I have read—nor those reported in the books mentioned—emphasize doctrinal points specific to any particular religion.</p><p>Howard Storm recounts that during his experience he was able to ask many questions to Jesus and to several angels. In his book <em>My Descent into Death</em>, he reports having asked, “What is the best religion?” He explains:</p><figure class=quote-hero><blockquote>I expected them to answer something like Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic, or another denomination. They replied: “the religion that brings you closer to God […] the purpose of religion is to help you have a personal relationship with God.”</blockquote></figure><div class=page-navigation><a href=https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section4/ class="nav-link prev"><div class=nav-arrow>&lt;</div><div class=nav-text><div class=nav-label>PREVIOUS</div><div class=nav-title>6.4 Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received</div></div></a></div></article><footer class=book-footer><footer class=site-footer><p>© 2026 <strong>The Rational Pilgrim</strong> — All rights reserved</p><nav class=footer-nav><a href=https://therationalpilgrim.com/en/>Home</a> |
