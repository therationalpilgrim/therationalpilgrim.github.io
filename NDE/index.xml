Raymond Moody, a physician and philosopher, initially had no interest in spiritual phenomena. Coming from a rational and skeptical background, he described himself as a materialist: he believed consciousness was solely a product of the brain, and that death marked the absolute end of existence. He therefore had no particular expectation of an afterlife.
&lt;p>Everything changed in the 1960s, while he was still a philosophy student. Moody met psychiatrist Dr. George Ritchie, who told him about an incident during which he believed he had traveled to the afterlife while he was dead for nearly nine minutes at the age of 20 (Ritchie later recounted this experience in his book &lt;em>Return From Tomorrow&lt;/em>, published in 1978). Moody began documenting similar accounts from other people who had experienced clinical death and discovered that many of these experiences shared common features, such as the sensation of leaving the body, passing through a tunnel, meeting deceased relatives, and seeing a radiant light. The more he heard, the more he was struck by the consistency of these narratives coming from people of very different backgrounds—sometimes atheists, sometimes believers—often profoundly changed upon their return.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Negative Near-Death Experience</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.2 Negative Near-Death Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Are there people who have experienced a negative near-death experience, close to the traditional image of hell?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes. Although positive accounts are by far the most common, there are disturbing testimonies of so-called “negative” NDEs, involving feelings of anguish, isolation, or even damnation. The book &lt;em>Life After Death – Why We Should Believe&lt;/em> briefly addresses this topic, citing several studies (Greyson, Bush, Moody).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authors (Chambon and Riffard) point out that:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Post-Mortem Stages</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.3 Post-Mortem Stages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the book &amp;ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire&amp;rdquo; (i.e. &lt;em>Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed&lt;/em>), psychiatrist Olivier Chambon and psychologist Marie-Odile Riffard invite us to rethink death. Far from religious dogma or materialist skepticism, they advocate a rational, scientific approach that remains open to the possibility that consciousness survives the death of the body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on more than 40 years of international research, the authors explore a coherent set of phenomena: near-death experiences (NDEs), out-of-body experiences, post-mortem communications, memories of past lives, and experiences under spiritual hypnosis. These phenomena are not isolated; thousands of cases have been documented, often with methodological rigor and verifiable elements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.4 Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people who have experienced a near-death experience (NDE) report encountering a &lt;strong>being of light&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Jesus&lt;/strong>, or a &lt;strong>divine presence&lt;/strong> of absolute love. These encounters often mark a radical turning point in their understanding of life and the meaning of existence. Below is a synthesis of the recurring teachings, illuminated by powerful testimonies.&lt;/p>

 💫 “You Are Loved as You Are”
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#-you-are-loved-as-you-are">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The being of light—whether perceived as God, Jesus, an angel, or a universal presence—welcomes each soul with immeasurable love and complete knowledge of who they are. This love is described as &lt;em>infinite, pure, and nonjudgmental&lt;/em>, a deeply unsettling revelation for those who experience it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Happens After Death? – Conclusions</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.5 Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The books by Raymond Moody, as well as the french book &amp;ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire&amp;rdquo; (i.e. &lt;em>Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed&lt;/em>) by Olivier Chambon and Marie-Odile Riffard, profoundly transformed my perception of death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These works led me to question the idea—deeply rooted in my traditional Christian upbringing—that death would be a final judgment, permanently sealing our fate. On the contrary, the testimonies they compile suggest that death is a transition to another plane of existence, where consciousness survives and where the soul can continue to evolve and grow spiritually.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
