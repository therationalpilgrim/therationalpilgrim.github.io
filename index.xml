Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For thousands of years, humanity has witnessed phenomena it could not explain and often saw them as signs or actions of the divine. Over time, however, science has advanced, shedding light where once there were only mysteries and beliefs.&lt;br>
In the Middle Ages, for example, the Black Death was interpreted as divine punishment. Illnesses were seen as consequences of sin or as tests of faith. Today, we know that microbes, viruses, and parasites cause many of these diseases, while others are linked to genetics. Medicine has made great strides in uncovering their origins and developing treatments.&lt;br>
Likewise, an eclipse was once feared as an omen from the gods. Now astronomy can predict exactly when and where it will occur, thanks to our understanding of orbits and planetary alignments.&lt;br>
Isn’t it worth asking, then, what still belongs to the realm of the divine?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Approaching the Spiritual Quest Scientifically?</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/method/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/method/</guid><description>&lt;h1 class="custom-title"> 2. Approaching the Spiritual Quest Scientifically?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Even what seems most concrete, rational, and undeniable — like mathematics — ultimately rests on assumptions. Any proven statement takes the form: &lt;em>if we assume XX, then we can prove YY through reasoning&lt;/em> (even if the assumptions are not always stated explicitly). These basic assumptions are called axioms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the Larousse dictionary, an &lt;strong>axiom&lt;/strong> is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In Aristotelian logic, the starting point of reasoning, considered self-evident and not demonstrable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The initial statement of an axiomatized theory, serving as the foundation for further demonstrations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An unquestioned proposition, accepted as the basis of an intellectual, social, or moral framework — a truth admitted by all without discussion.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For example, Euclidean plane geometry (geometry on a flat surface, like a sheet of paper) is built on five axioms, known as &lt;em>Euclid’s postulates&lt;/em> (
 &lt;a href="http://www.bibmath.net">bibmath.net&lt;/a>):&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toward the Existence of the God of Philosophers</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 4. Toward the Existence of the God of Philosophers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the previous chapter, we started from the following axioms (see Chapter 2 for a definition of axioms):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #007acc; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 1em; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1.5em 0;"> 
&lt;strong>Axiom 1:&lt;/strong> Everything that begins to exist has a cause.&lt;br>
&lt;strong>Axiom 2:&lt;/strong> The universe began to exist.&lt;br> 
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>From these, we derived the following statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #007acc; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 1em; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1.5em 0;"> 
&lt;strong>Statement 1:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Since the universe had a beginning, it must depend on a cause outside itself — an uncreated, immaterial, timeless, supremely powerful, and intentional or personal reality. 
This reality constitutes the &lt;strong>First Cause&lt;/strong> of all that exists.
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But can we go further? Can we show that this First Cause is not a mere impersonal force, but a being endowed with intelligence and will — what philosophers have long called &lt;em>God&lt;/em>, not in the religious sense, but in the &lt;strong>philosophical&lt;/strong> one?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Which Divine Revelation to Follow?</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/plurality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/plurality/</guid><description>&lt;h1 class="custom-title"> 5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the previous chapters, we reviewed several considerations that make the following two premises (or axioms) reasonable: everything that begins to exist has a cause (&lt;strong>Axiom 1&lt;/strong>), and the universe began to exist (&lt;strong>Axiom 2&lt;/strong>). From these foundations, it is reasonable to conclude that the universe depends on a reality without beginning, unmoving, uncreated, necessary, and outside time — the first cause of all that exists (&lt;strong>Statement 1&lt;/strong>). This first cause appears as an immaterial, eternal, necessary, intelligent, free, and unique being, which philosophical reasoning allows us to identify as the God of philosophers (&lt;strong>Statement 2&lt;/strong>). From this analysis follow three consequences: God is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent; He is perfect — fully complete in Himself; and He is just, acting according to truth and goodness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Big Bang Theory and Alternative Models</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.1 The Big Bang Theory and Alternative Models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, a series of major scientific discoveries has profoundly transformed our understanding of the universe. Moving away from the idea of a static and eternal cosmos, astronomical observations — notably Edwin Hubble’s measurements of the redshift of distant galaxies — revealed that the universe is expanding. This discovery led to the development of the Big Bang model, which describes the universe as having evolved from an extremely hot and dense state approximately 13.7 billion years ago &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past?</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another argument for a beginning of time and the universe rests on a mathematical intuition: the past cannot be infinite, because it would be impossible to &lt;em>cross&lt;/em> such an infinity and arrive at the present moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="potential-infinity-vs-actual-infinity">
 Potential Infinity vs. Actual Infinity
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#potential-infinity-vs-actual-infinity">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is important to distinguish two fundamental notions of infinity:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Potential infinity&lt;/strong>: a quantity that can increase without bound but is always finite at each stage. For example, counting 1, 2, 3… without ever reaching an “infinite number.” In mathematics this corresponds to the concept of a limit, where a value tends toward infinity without ever attaining it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the previous sections, we saw that &lt;strong>the universe very likely had a beginning&lt;/strong>. Whether through the Big Bang theory or the impossibility of crossing an infinite regress of past events, all evidence suggests that the cosmos is not eternal in the past.&lt;br>
We are therefore faced with a profound and dizzying question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why is there something rather than nothing?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If the universe began to exist, then &lt;strong>something outside the universe must have caused that beginning&lt;/strong>. This brings us to the &lt;strong>Kalām Cosmological Argument&lt;/strong>, revitalized in modern philosophy by William Lane Craig.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause &lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have seen that if the universe began to exist, and if everything that begins to exist has a cause, it logically follows that &lt;strong>the universe has a cause&lt;/strong>.&lt;br>
But what kind of cause could account for the very existence of everything that exists?
A philosophical analysis of the necessary conditions for such a cause reveals several essential properties:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>Non-Physical Cause&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Toward the Existence of a Creative Force - Conclusions</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/aff1/section5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title"> 3.5 Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Today, the Big Bang model remains the most successful scientific explanation of the origin and evolution of the universe.&lt;br>
It aligns with the major observations — from the cosmic microwave background to the abundance of light elements and the formation of large-scale structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is therefore neither irrational nor scientifically unfounded to think that the universe had a beginning — an origin point about 13.8 billion years ago, characterized by an extremely hot and dense state.&lt;br>
From both philosophical and mathematical perspectives, the idea of an &lt;em>actually infinite&lt;/em> past presents serious difficulties: a truly infinite sequence of successive events could never be &lt;strong>crossed&lt;/strong> step by step — yet we have clearly reached the present.&lt;br>
This suggests that time had a beginning and that the series of past events is not infinite. On this basis, we can state as &lt;strong>Axiom 2&lt;/strong> that the universe began to exist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Near-Death Experience and Shared Death Experience</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.1 Near-Death Experience and Shared Death Experience&lt;/h2>

Raymond Moody, a physician and philosopher, initially had no interest in spiritual phenomena. Coming from a rational and skeptical background, he described himself as a materialist: he believed consciousness was solely a product of the brain, and that death marked the absolute end of existence. He therefore had no particular expectation of an afterlife.
&lt;p>Everything changed in the 1960s, while he was still a philosophy student. Moody met psychiatrist Dr. George Ritchie, who told him about an incident during which he believed he had traveled to the afterlife while he was dead for nearly nine minutes at the age of 20 (Ritchie later recounted this experience in his book &lt;em>Return From Tomorrow&lt;/em>, published in 1978). Moody began documenting similar accounts from other people who had experienced clinical death and discovered that many of these experiences shared common features, such as the sensation of leaving the body, passing through a tunnel, meeting deceased relatives, and seeing a radiant light. The more he heard, the more he was struck by the consistency of these narratives coming from people of very different backgrounds—sometimes atheists, sometimes believers—often profoundly changed upon their return.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Negative Near-Death Experience</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.2 Negative Near-Death Experience&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Are there people who have experienced a negative near-death experience, close to the traditional image of hell?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes. Although positive accounts are by far the most common, there are disturbing testimonies of so-called “negative” NDEs, involving feelings of anguish, isolation, or even damnation. The book &lt;em>Life After Death – Why We Should Believe&lt;/em> briefly addresses this topic, citing several studies (Greyson, Bush, Moody).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The authors (Chambon and Riffard) point out that:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Post-Mortem Stages</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section3/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.3 Post-Mortem Stages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the book &amp;ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire&amp;rdquo; (i.e. &lt;em>Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed&lt;/em>), psychiatrist Olivier Chambon and psychologist Marie-Odile Riffard invite us to rethink death. Far from religious dogma or materialist skepticism, they advocate a rational, scientific approach that remains open to the possibility that consciousness survives the death of the body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on more than 40 years of international research, the authors explore a coherent set of phenomena: near-death experiences (NDEs), out-of-body experiences, post-mortem communications, memories of past lives, and experiences under spiritual hypnosis. These phenomena are not isolated; thousands of cases have been documented, often with methodological rigor and verifiable elements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.4 Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people who have experienced a near-death experience (NDE) report encountering a &lt;strong>being of light&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Jesus&lt;/strong>, or a &lt;strong>divine presence&lt;/strong> of absolute love. These encounters often mark a radical turning point in their understanding of life and the meaning of existence. Below is a synthesis of the recurring teachings, illuminated by powerful testimonies.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="-you-are-loved-as-you-are">
 💫 “You Are Loved as You Are”
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#-you-are-loved-as-you-are">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The being of light—whether perceived as God, Jesus, an angel, or a universal presence—welcomes each soul with immeasurable love and complete knowledge of who they are. This love is described as &lt;em>infinite, pure, and nonjudgmental&lt;/em>, a deeply unsettling revelation for those who experience it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Happens After Death? – Conclusions</title><link>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://therationalpilgrim.com/NDE/section5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="custom-title">6.5 Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The books by Raymond Moody, as well as the french book &amp;ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire&amp;rdquo; (i.e. &lt;em>Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed&lt;/em>) by Olivier Chambon and Marie-Odile Riffard, profoundly transformed my perception of death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These works led me to question the idea—deeply rooted in my traditional Christian upbringing—that death would be a final judgment, permanently sealing our fate. On the contrary, the testimonies they compile suggest that death is a transition to another plane of existence, where consciousness survives and where the soul can continue to evolve and grow spiritually.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
