Introduction For thousands of years, humanity has witnessed phenomena it could not explain and often saw them as signs or actions of the divine. Over time, however, science has advanced, shedding light where once there were only mysteries and beliefs.\nIn the Middle Ages, for example, the Black Death was interpreted as divine punishment. Illnesses were seen as consequences of sin or as tests of faith. Today, we know that microbes, viruses, and parasites cause many of these diseases, while others are linked to genetics. Medicine has made great strides in uncovering their origins and developing treatments.\nLikewise, an eclipse was once feared as an omen from the gods. Now astronomy can predict exactly when and where it will occur, thanks to our understanding of orbits and planetary alignments.\nIsn’t it worth asking, then, what still belongs to the realm of the divine?\nScience has indeed explained much of what was once mysterious, especially the questions of \u0026lsquo;how\u0026rsquo;, such as:\nHow stars are formed, How diseases spread, How species evolve over time. Yet some questions remain unanswered — especially the deeper \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; questions, for instance:\nWhy does the universe exist at all? Why is there something rather than nothing? And those that touch on the immaterial:\nIs death truly the end, or does consciousness continue beyond it? How did life first emerge, and for what purpose? This text is written for those who, like me, seek a spirituality that can be reconciled with reason and with what we know today. I believe spirituality and science are not enemies, but companions in the search for truth.\nImage by Noah Buscher – Unsplash A little science estranges men from God, but much science leads them back to Him. — Louis Pasteur On the other hand, however, every one who is seriously engaged in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. The pursuit of science leads therefore to a religious feeling of a special kind, which differs essentially from the religiosity of more naive people. — Albert Einstein (1999, Einstein and Religion: Physics and Theology by Max Jammer, Quote Page 93, Princeton University Press.) \u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT Starting page SUIVANT 2. Approaching the spiritual quest scientifically? \u0026gt; "},{"id":1,"href":"/method/","title":"2. Approaching the Spiritual Quest Scientifically?","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 2. Approaching the Spiritual Quest Scientifically? Even what seems most concrete, rational, and undeniable — like mathematics — ultimately rests on assumptions. Any proven statement takes the form: if we assume XX, then we can prove YY through reasoning (even if the assumptions are not always stated explicitly). These basic assumptions are called axioms.\nAccording to the Larousse dictionary, an axiom is:\nIn Aristotelian logic, the starting point of reasoning, considered self-evident and not demonstrable. The initial statement of an axiomatized theory, serving as the foundation for further demonstrations. An unquestioned proposition, accepted as the basis of an intellectual, social, or moral framework — a truth admitted by all without discussion. For example, Euclidean plane geometry (geometry on a flat surface, like a sheet of paper) is built on five axioms, known as Euclid’s postulates (\rbibmath.net):\nThrough any two points, there is always a straight line. Any line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. From a given segment, one can construct a circle whose center is at one endpoint and whose radius is the length of the segment. All right angles are equal to one another. Given a point and a line not passing through it, there exists exactly one line parallel to the first that passes through the point (the parallel postulate). These statements are easy to verify in practice — for instance, if you mark two points on a page, you can easily draw a straight line through them with a ruler. But formally proving them is impossible.\nFrom these axioms, the rest of plane geometry can be deduced and demonstrated. For example, the parallel postulate leads to the conclusion that the angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees.\nThis shows that nothing is absolutely provable — not even mathematics. It, too, rests on assumptions, whether explicit or implicit. In this sense, everything is relative. The same is true for the sciences: physics, cosmology, biology, even medicine.\nTake clinical trials, for instance. When a study shows that a drug outperforms a placebo, the conclusion relies on statistical methods. Even here, results come with a margin of error. A common threshold is p \u0026lt; 0.05 — meaning there is still a 5% chance that the observed effect is due to random variation, that patients improved by chance rather than because the drug worked. Beyond this, results rest on underlying assumptions, such as:\nThat participants are representative of the general population, That the measurements used (e.g., symptom scores) are valid and reliable, That the observed effect truly comes from the drug, not from uncontrolled biases (like expectation effects, measurement errors, or contextual factors), That the chosen statistical analyses are appropriate for the data. In other words, even a “significant” result is never absolute proof. It is a probabilistic conclusion, valid only within a well-designed methodological framework.\nScientific theories — from atomic models to the laws of gravity — work the same way. They aim to best explain observations, but they too rest on assumptions, have limitations, and evolve as new discoveries emerge.\nThe scientific method does not use the verb 'to believe'; science merely proposes provisional explanatory models of reality, ready to be revised as soon as new information contradicts them. — Albert Jacquard , Petite philosophie à l’usage des non-philosophes (1997) (translated in english) A theory is not disproven simply because certain observations seem inconsistent with it. It only means the theory cannot explain everything. Like us, it has limits.\nThe scientific method generally follows these steps:\nObserve a phenomenon: What is happening in nature? Observations may come from experience, reflection, or research. Ask meaningful questions: Why does this phenomenon occur? What factors influence it? Formulate a theory (with its assumptions/axioms) to explain the phenomenon. Make testable predictions: If my theory is correct, I should observe X, Y, Z\u0026hellip; Experiment and collect data: Data may come from studies, observations, or controlled experiments. For validity, results must be reproducible. Analyze results and adjust the theory if needed: Do the findings support the hypothesis, or must it be revised? Develop a general theory: A scientific theory should be consistent with most available data and compatible with other established theories. Image by [Dr. Blake Porter](https://www.blakeporterneuro.com/) In this blog, I propose to explore the question of God’s existence using an approach inspired by the scientific method. The goal is not to prove the existence of God scientifically — which would be impossible, since God is not a physical, measurable, or directly observable phenomenon. However, if God does exist, it is reasonable to ask what effects such an existence might have on the world.\nThis reflection will therefore proceed in that spirit: by gathering information from different sources, examining which hypotheses best account for the greatest number of observable elements, and identifying those that appear the most coherent, rational, and reasonable.\nAs in science or mathematics, this approach rests on certain intuitively sensible starting principles — comparable to Euclid’s axioms in geometry — which cannot be proven in themselves, but from which it becomes possible to build an understanding of reality and to draw conclusions.\nI therefore propose to examine the different sources of evidence, to formulate these foundational hypotheses, and then to explore their implications. This inquiry will remain open-ended: it may evolve in light of new experiences, discoveries, or information, just as scientific research does.\n\u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 1. Introduction SUIVANT 3.

Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 3. Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?\rSince antiquity, philosophers and scientists have debated the nature of the universe: has it always existed, or did it have a beginning? Thinkers like Aristotle defended the idea of an eternal universe, without origin or end.\nIt is therefore clear, from all that has been said, that the whole heaven has not been created, nor can it perish, as some philosophers claim. Rather, it is one and eternal, without beginning or end, enduring for all eternity.\r— Aristotle , On the Heavens, Book II, https://remacle.org/bloodwolf/philosophes/Aristote/ciel2.htm\rBy contrast, other philosophical and religious traditions have argued for an origin of the universe, sometimes associated with a creative cause or force.\nIn this chapter, we will adopt a rigorous scientific approach (see Chapter 2) in order to retrace the major discoveries and observations that led to the Big Bang model and its modern developments (inflation, ΛCDM).\nEach cosmological model — whether the standard model or alternative proposals — will be examined critically, by assessing both its explanatory strengths, its limitations, and its degree of compatibility with current observational data.\nWe will also examine the arguments put forward in support of alternative models, as well as the conceptual or empirical difficulties they face, in order to determine which hypotheses appear most consistent with the current state of scientific research.\nIn a second step, we will broaden the discussion to the philosophical level and examine whether an infinite past can be conceived rationally.\nTwo questions will guide our inquiry:\nDoes the universe have a beginning? If so, can we reasonably infer the existence of a “first cause” or a creative force? We will address these questions through the following steps:\nThe Big Bang theory and alternative models Is it possible to traverse an infinite past? Why is there something rather than nothing? What kind of cause could create a universe? Conclusions ⚠️ Note to the reader: Section 3.1 is primarily scientific, while sections 3.2 and 3.4 are more philosophical in nature.

Toward the Existence of the God of Philosophers","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 4. Toward the Existence of the God of Philosophers In the previous chapter, we started from the following axioms (see Chapter 2 for a definition of axioms):\nAxiom 1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\nAxiom 2: The universe began to exist.\nFrom these, we derived the following statement:\nStatement 1:\nSince the universe had a beginning, it must depend on a cause outside itself — an uncreated, immaterial, timeless, supremely powerful, and intentional or personal reality. This reality constitutes the First Cause of all that exists. But can we go further? Can we show that this First Cause is not a mere impersonal force, but a being endowed with intelligence and will — what philosophers have long called God, not in the religious sense, but in the philosophical one?\nThat is what we shall explore here, following a purely rational line of reasoning while addressing the main objections.\n1. The First Cause Is Necessary\r#\rLet us begin by distinguishing two fundamental notions:\nA contingent being is something that could have failed to exist. Its existence depends on something else — on external conditions or causes.\nExamples: a tree, a star, a person, a planet\u0026hellip; all appeared at some point in time and could just as well not have existed.\nA necessary being, by contrast, is one that cannot not exist.\nIt exists by itself, independently of anything else. It has no cause, no beginning, and no end.\nIts essence entails its existence.\nThese two notions are essential to understanding why the First Cause cannot be contingent but must be necessary.\nReasoning — why the First Cause cannot be contingent:\nA contingent being does not exist by itself; it requires an external cause. But the First Cause is, by definition, the ultimate explanation of everything else — the source of all that begins to exist. If the First Cause were contingent, it would itself require a cause — and would no longer be “first.” It is therefore incoherent to suppose a “First Cause” that depends on another reality. Hence, the First Cause cannot be contingent. It must be necessary — existing by its own nature, uncaused and unconditional.\n2. The First Cause Is Immutable\r#\rWe have seen that the First Cause is a necessary being — existing by itself, without dependence or external cause.\nBut why must it also be unchanging?\nChange means passing from one state to another — gaining what one previously lacked or losing what one had. Every change therefore implies: a kind of imperfection or lack, a transition from potentiality to actuality, and dependence on something external to actualize that change. A necessary being, however, cannot possess potentiality: It is fully actual, complete, and self-sufficient. It lacks nothing, since it is the cause of all and depends on nothing. It is not subject to becoming or transformation. Thus, a necessary being must be immutable.\nIt does not change because it is pure act — it is, fully and eternally.\n3. The First Cause Is Intelligent\r#\rThe universe exhibits a profound order: consistent laws, elegant mathematical structures, and astonishing harmony. Such order naturally suggests intelligence — just as a plan implies an architect. Objection:\nOrder might arise spontaneously from physical laws. The anthropic principle claims that we observe an ordered universe simply because only ordered universes can host observers like us.\nResponse:\nEven if one posits a multiverse, this does not explain why any universe — or its laws — should be mathematically elegant, stable, and intelligible. The very intelligibility of reality remains puzzling unless there is an intelligence at its source.\n4. The First Cause Is Unique\r#\rTwo “first causes” would be absurd, for there would need to be something that differentiates them — and that “something” would then be more fundamental. Hence, there can only be one necessary being: unique, infinite, intelligent, and free. Objection:\nWhy couldn’t two necessary realities coexist without causing each other?\nResponse:\nTwo distinct realities would entail differences that call for explanation. A truly necessary being cannot include within itself anything contingent or dependent — and thus cannot be multiple.\n✧ Intermediate Conclusion\r#\rStatement 2:\nThis First Cause is a necessary, immutable, intelligent, free, and unique being — what philosophers call the God of philosophers. 5. Omnipresence, Omniscience, Omnipotence\r#\rOmnipresence: Being beyond time and space, God is present to all of creation. Omniscience: Being present to all things, He knows all things directly and perfectly. Omnipotence: As the source of all that exists, He can bring about everything that is logically possible. Objection:\nIf God already knows everything, can He still be free? Can He change His mind? Richard Dawkins once asked ironically:\n“Can an omniscient God, who knows the future, find the omnipotence to change His future mind?”\nResponse:\nGod, being outside time, does not have a “future” to change. He knows all things in a single, timeless act — including what He has freely willed. Moreover, divine omnipotence does not include the power to do what is logically absurd (e.g., create a square circle); this is not a limitation but a reflection of coherence.\n6. Is God Perfect?\r#\rBefore affirming that God is perfect, we must clarify what “perfection” means in philosophy. In the classical tradition (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas), a being is perfect when it fully realizes what it is by nature. That is:\nIt lacks nothing. It fully achieves what it is meant to be. It possesses, to the highest degree, all positive attributes (perfections): being, intelligence, goodness, power, etc. For example, a perfect circle is one whose points are all exactly equidistant from its center. Likewise, a perfect being possesses all perfections without deficiency.\nTo affirm that God is perfect, we must show that He possesses:\nAll possible perfections (being, unity, truth, goodness, power, wisdom, etc.), To the maximal degree — without limit, defect, or dependence. The key point is that God is a necessary being. A necessary being cannot lack anything, for lack implies dependence. It cannot change, for change implies potentiality. It cannot be limited, for limitation implies imperfection. Therefore, a necessary being is necessarily perfect: lacking nothing, dependent on nothing, and possessing all perfections compatible with its nature.\nNote:\nThe problem of evil is a classic objection to divine perfection. We will address it in a later chapter.\n7. Is God Just?\r#\rIn classical philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas), justice is defined as:\n“The constant will to render to each what is due to them.”\nA being is just if it:\nRecognizes the intrinsic value of each being, Acts accordingly, And treats each according to what they deserve or are owed. For a being to be just, it must:\nKnow what is due to each (omniscience), Will the good of each (goodness), Act according to that knowledge and will (freedom and omnipotence). Hence, God is just because He possesses intelligence to know, will to desire, and power to accomplish what is right — perfectly and without error.\nObjection:\nHow can divine justice be reconciled with the existence of suffering and injustice in the world?\nResponse:\nDivine justice may operate on a plane that transcends our immediate temporal perspective. It encompasses what we cannot yet see or understand — a topic that will also be explored later.\nConclusion\r#\rFrom Statement 1 and Statement 2, we can infer:\nConsequence 1:\nGod is omnipotent (all-powerful), omnipresent (present everywhere and at all times), and omniscient (of infinite knowledge).\nConsequence 2:\nGod is perfect, possessing all possible perfections (being, unity, truth, goodness, power, wisdom, etc.) to the highest degree — without limit, defect, or dependence.\nConsequence 3:\nGod is just: He recognizes the intrinsic worth of each being, acts accordingly, and treats each according to what they deserve or are owed.\nThese divine attributes, however, are the subject of significant philosophical debate. But if God truly exists and possesses such perfections, a decisive question arises: how can human beings reasonably draw near to Him? Among the revelations, traditions, and spiritual experiences that claim to provide access to the divine, which ones deserve to be taken seriously? This is what I propose to explore in the following chapter.\n\u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 3.5 Conclusions SUIVANT 5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow? \u0026gt; "},{"id":4,"href":"/plurality/","title":"5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow?","section":"The rational pilgrim","content":" 5. Which Divine Revelation to Follow? In the previous chapters, we reviewed several considerations that make the following two premises (or axioms) reasonable: everything that begins to exist has a cause (Axiom 1), and the universe began to exist (Axiom 2). From these foundations, it is reasonable to conclude that the universe depends on a reality without beginning, unmoving, uncreated, necessary, and outside time — the first cause of all that exists (Statement 1). This first cause appears as an immaterial, eternal, necessary, intelligent, free, and unique being, which philosophical reasoning allows us to identify as the God of philosophers (Statement 2). From this analysis follow three consequences: God is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent; He is perfect — fully complete in Himself; and He is just, acting according to truth and goodness.\nIf such a God exists, it is reasonable to think that He has revealed Himself to humanity. Many religions claim to transmit this revelation; but in the face of their diversity, a crucial question arises: Is there a single truth and, if so, which religion or belief comes closest to it?\nThe idea that only one religion is the exclusive path to God and salvation seems difficult to reconcile with divine justice, because religious affiliation largely depends on birthplace, culture, and circumstance, and conversions remain rare at a global scale. Such exclusivity would imply a fundamental inequality among human beings, which conflicts with the notion of a perfectly just God.\nTo grasp the impact of claiming a single path to God, consider a few statistics. First, look at the distribution of people by religion, globally and by country. According to the Pew Research Center, Christians made up the largest religious group worldwide in 2020 — nearly a third (29%) of the world’s 7.9 billion people. Muslims were second, with about 2 billion people (26%), followed by the unaffiliated (24%), Hindus (15%), and Buddhists (6%). Followers of traditional religions, Jews, and members of other religions account for smaller shares of the global population. These percentages vary greatly by country: Christian shares are particularly high in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Southern Africa; they represent only ~2% of India’s population but about 81% in Portugal. Islam is dominant in MENA and parts of South and Southeast Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indonesia). The “least religious” countries include China, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, and France. Buddhism is concentrated in East and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Laos, and Japan.\nTable: Share of the adult population affiliated with each major religion, by country (2020) Country Christianity Islam Hinduism Buddhism Unaffiliated Other 🌍 World 28.8% 25.6% 15.0% 6.0% 24.2% ~0.4% 🇲🇽 Mexico ~94% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~5% ~1% 🇧🇷 Brazil ~86% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~8% ~5% 🇿🇦 South Africa ~84% ~2% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~13% ~1% 🇵🇹 Portugal ~81% ~1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~13% ~4% 🇮🇹 Italy ~80% ~3% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~12% ~4% 🇷🇺 Russia ~73% ~10% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~15% ~2% 🇺🇸 United States ~65% ~1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~26% ~8% 🇩🇪 Germany ~60% ~7% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~28% ~5% 🇨🇭 Switzerland ~60% ~5% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~28% ~6% 🇫🇷 France ~55% ~8% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~30% ~7% 🇮🇩 Indonesia ~10% ~87% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~2% ~1% 🇮🇱 Israel ~2% ~18% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~3% ~77% 🇮🇳 India ~2% ~14% 77% \u0026lt;1% ~1% ~6% 🇯🇵 Japan ~2% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% 36% 58% ~4% 🇨🇳 China ~5% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~4%¹ ~90% ~1% 🇱🇦 Laos \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~66% ~32% ~1% 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia \u0026lt;1% ~97% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~2% 🇦🇫 Afghanistan \u0026lt;1% ~99% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% – 🇳🇬 Nigeria ~46% ~52% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% ~1% 🇹🇭 Thailand \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% \u0026lt;1% 93% ~5% ~1% 📝 Notes\r#\r¹ In China, religious affiliation is difficult to estimate precisely. A large share practice non-institutional or traditional forms (Taoism, Confucianism, ancestor veneration). In Israel, the “Other” category is primarily Jewish (~77%). Pew Research Center data available at https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/feature/religious-composition-by-country-2010-2020/ Second, a 2025 Pew Research Center study (\rhttps://www.pewresearch.org) reports that about 10% of adults under 55 worldwide have left the religion of their childhood. Most of these become religiously unaffiliated, contributing to a slight global decline in the religious share from 77% (2010) to 76% (2020). Only about 3% switch to a different religion. Retention rates vary markedly across traditions: Hindus show remarkable retention (about 1% departures), closely followed by Muslims. By contrast, the unaffiliated largely remain unaffiliated, though some join a faith. Suppose the following claim were true: “Only one religion is the true path to God and leads to salvation.” Based on the patterns above, this would entail a clear inequality of opportunity among individuals.\nFor example, if Christianity were the sole path to God, then only about 2% of Indians would have a realistic chance of being saved, given that Hindus show very low conversion rates (~1%). Even though nearly everyone can potentially discover other religions through the internet, television, or daily encounters, that exposure rarely triggers a change of belief. Social and family pressures, political climate, and — quite simply — the intuitive assumption that if any religion is true, it is probably the one we were born into and know best all play a role.\nThus, if God offered only a single exclusive path to salvation, it would amount to granting major spiritual privileges by birth — apparently incompatible with equitable divine justice.\nSince God is just, each human being should have a real chance to access truth and salvation. Many theologians and religious thinkers address this through religious pluralism and inclusivism:\nReligious pluralism: All major religions are valid expressions of spiritual search and can lead to the divine. Each tradition, with its cultural and historical particularities, offers a path toward God or salvation. If God is just, then multiple religious paths would be valid in their own ways. Inclusivism: One religion may be understood as true (e.g., Christianity from a Christian perspective), yet God, in His mercy, extends salvation to those who do not know that religion, according to their sincerity and good actions. This approach combines a unique truth-claim with a divine justice that reaches all, including those without access to that particular truth. Personally, I lean toward pluralism. I find it likely that God revealed Himself to humanity in different ways, across cultures and throughout history. Each religion may thus hold part of the truth from a certain perspective. We will look at some indications in favor of this view in the next chapter.\nBut which religion should one choose? Which path draws us closer to God? I believe the path to God is profoundly personal and varies from person to person, because we are all different. Some are touched by a simple encounter — like Leslie Strobel, whose faith began after a neighbor invited her to church. Others — like the scientist Rosalind Picard — discover God through an inner search and spiritual reading, after long thinking faith was unnecessary. Others, like Akiane Kramarik, speak of encountering God in mystical experience. And then there are those — Lee Strobel or C. S. Lewis — who undertake a rigorous intellectual journey, weighing facts, texts, and reason, before becoming convinced that God exists. Whether through emotion, experience, doubt, or logic, God seems to shape a path suited to each heart and mind. For belief does not follow a single pattern: it is a meeting, tailored to the person.\nLet’s look more closely at each person’s story to illustrate the diversity of paths that lead toward God.\n1. Lee Strobel and his wife Leslie It was first his wife, Leslie, who encountered Christian faith after a neighbor invited her to a church service. Moved by the message and the community’s kindness, she began a sincere journey of faith marked by deep inner change. This worried Lee, then an investigative journalist at the Chicago Tribune and a convinced atheist. Fearing that this new faith would threaten their relationship, he decided to conduct a rigorous investigation — not to seek the truth, but to prove to his wife that she was wrong to believe.\nFor two years, Lee interviewed historians, theologians, medical experts, and New Testament scholars. He examined the case for and against the resurrection, the historicity of the Gospels, and the reliability of eyewitness testimony. To his surprise, the evidence he uncovered challenged his skepticism. His careful, honest inquiry led him to faith. He tells this story in The Case for Christ, a bestseller later adapted for film.\nI highly recommend the book — it reads like a detective novel. I will draw on several of its themes in the sections on Christianity, notably arguments concerning the credibility of the disciples’ testimony, the death of Jesus, and his resurrection.\n📖 Book: Strobel, L.

Rosalind Picard: from atheism to Christian faith Rosalind Picard, a renowned MIT researcher and pioneer of affective computing, long considered herself an atheist. A brilliant, science-minded child, she thought religious people were ignorant. She recalls:\nI used to think religious people were ignorant. Then I took the risk of believing in God. Her perspective began to shift when a physician couple she admired invited her to church. Surprised that such intelligent people were believers, she initially declined, then agreed to read the Bible out of intellectual curiosity. Image from https://www.premierchristianity.com/ She began with Proverbs, then read the entire Bible in a modern translation. To her surprise, she found deep wisdom and felt an inner voice that moved her:\nI never heard a voice, but I had this strange sense of being addressed. It was unsettling, yet strangely compelling. She then reread the Bible with the intent to refute it, while also exploring other religions. Over time, through reading and reflection, she came to believe that God is not an abstract concept but a living, loving reality:\nI realized God wasn’t a concept. He was alive. He loved me. Today, she says her faith does not contradict scientific rigor but provides a moral foundation and a deeper vision of human dignity.\n📖 A MIT professor meets the Author of all knowledge… 📖 Professor Rosalind Picard interview 📖 Testimony + video 📝 Talk text: “Intellectual Assurance – Is Christianity Sound?” 3. Akiane Kramarik Akiane was born July 9, 1994, in Mount Morris, Illinois. Her mother, Forelli, of Lithuanian origin, was an atheist; her father, Mark, a lapsed Catholic from Chicago, had left religious practice. The family lived in poverty in a cabin near a cornfield — no TV or radio, very little income.\nAt age four, Akiane began speaking of visions of God and heaven. In a home where God was not discussed, she nonetheless spoke about Jesus and God’s love.\nVery early, Akiane drew on walls and floors, then on sketchbooks. By six, she sensed that painting was her path, rising at 4 a.m. to draw, correct mistakes, and improve.\nAt eight, Akiane felt called to paint Jesus’ face as she had seen Him in her visions. After months of searching, she spent a day praying that God would send the right person. The next day, someone brought a carpenter to their door who looked exactly like the Jesus in her visions. In about 40 hours of work and 20 hours of modeling, she completed Prince of Peace. She explains that the illuminated side of the face symbolizes truth; the other, suffering — but the light shining in the dark eye means Jesus is always with us. Akiane Kramarik The original Prince of Peace, entrusted to an art agent, was stolen and held for ransom. After a legal battle, it was illicitly sold and hidden under a staircase. The owner later died; the family kept the painting in storage, refusing to exhibit or sell it. Only a high-quality reproduction allowed the image to spread, making it one of the artist’s best-known works.\nSixteen years later, the original resurfaced: it was purchased for $850,000 by a major collector, and Akiane was finally able to see it again — a deeply emotional moment.\nThe painting’s spiritual resonance grew when Colton Burpo (of Heaven Is for Real fame) identified it as the most faithful likeness of Jesus he had seen in his near-death experience.\nNow 30, Akiane remains deeply marked by her personal relationship with Jesus:\nSince no one told me who God was, I found Him myself… I don’t belong to any denomination; I belong to God. She dedicates her art to helping others, supports charities, and dreams of founding an art academy — seeing her talent as a way to draw people closer to God. Through her faith, her entire family (parents and siblings) also found their way to Jesus.\nFaithPot.com 📘 Book: Akiane: Her Life, Her Art, Her Poetry 🖼️ Official site 🎥 Video on Akiane, Interview, Akiane \u0026amp; Colton 4. C. S. Lewis An Oxford professor and brilliant intellect, C. S. Lewis was first a skeptical atheist. Over time — through reflection, conversations with believing friends like J. R. R. Tolkien, and his search for meaning — he concluded that Christianity best explains the human longing for justice, beauty, and truth. His conversion became a turning point; he devoted much of his work thereafter to clarifying and defending the Christian faith with depth and clarity.\n📖 Mere Christianity 🎥 Conversion testimony These accounts are personal narratives, but they help us understand the inner experiences that lead some people to faith.\n⚠️ Note: I found mainly testimonies of atheists becoming Christian. That’s not a deliberate selection bias on my part. It may reflect the Christian culture of giving testimonies, the language of my searches, or my search history. Please feel free to share accounts of people converting to other religions.\nConclusion:\nGod knows each of us intimately and traces a path tailored to each person. Whether through logic, art, spiritual experience, reading the Bible or the Qur’an, or meaningful encounters, every story is a unique testimony to divine love seeking to meet the human being where they are. In the next chapters, I’ll describe the path I followed. After reading many testimonies, I turned to what we can learn about what happens after death — especially near-death experiences. In parallel, I read the Bible and many works of Christian theology. I focused on Christianity because it is my cultural background and felt like a natural starting point.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/NDE/","title":"6.

Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?","content":" 3.1 The Big Bang Theory and Alternative Models Since the beginning of the 20th century, a series of major scientific discoveries has profoundly transformed our understanding of the universe. Moving away from the idea of a static and eternal cosmos, astronomical observations — notably Edwin Hubble’s measurements of the redshift of distant galaxies — revealed that the universe is expanding. This discovery led to the development of the Big Bang model, which describes the universe as having evolved from an extremely hot and dense state approximately 13.7 billion years ago 1.\nToday, the Big Bang model is widely accepted within the scientific community and is supported by several independent lines of observational evidence, such as the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of light elements. However, it has not gone unchallenged. Alternative cosmological models — including steady-state theories and various cyclic or bouncing scenarios — have been proposed, often motivated by conceptual concerns about an absolute beginning or by attempts to address unresolved questions within the standard model.\nIn this section, we will examine both the Big Bang model and its main alternatives by evaluating the motivations behind each proposal, the phenomena they seek to explain, and the strengths and limitations they encounter when confronted with current observational data. Our aim is to clarify why certain models have gained broader acceptance, while others remain active areas of theoretical exploration.\nThis comparative approach will allow us to better understand both the success of the Big Bang framework and the reasons why the question of the universe’s origin remains an open and intellectually active field of research.\nThe Early Days of the Big Bang Theory\r#\rAlbert Einstein and General Relativity (1915)\nIn 1915, Albert Einstein published the theory of general relativity — a new way to describe gravitation, not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime produced by mass and energy. His equations implied that the universe is dynamic: it must either expand or contract. Uncomfortable with that conclusion (he believed the universe was static), he introduced the cosmological constant, a mathematical term to prevent collapse or expansion. He later called it his “greatest blunder,” even though a modern version of the cosmological constant (dark energy) has been reintroduced to explain the accelerated expansion. Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lemaître: the expanding universe (1920s)\n1922–1924: Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann published solutions to Einstein’s equations showing that the universe can expand or contract. He demonstrated mathematically that a static universe is not the only option. In 1927, Belgian priest-physicist Georges Lemaître built on these solutions and connected them to observations: he proposed that the universe is expanding and began in an extremely dense, hot state — later dubbed the “primeval atom.” He established the distance–redshift relation and derived an expansion constant. An important nuance: Lemaître did not use a “radiation rate” to measure this expansion; he relied on galactic spectral redshifts and distance estimates. Their theoretical work provided the conceptual footing for the Big Bang model.\nObservational Evidence for the Big Bang\r#\rSeveral independent observations support the picture of a universe that was once much hotter and denser and has been expanding for billions of years.\nExpansion of the universe — the Hubble–Lemaître law\nIn 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that the farther away a galaxy is, the more its light is redshifted (relation v = H₀ d). He combined distance measurements (Cepheids, and later other indicators) with velocities (spectral lines). What does this redshift mean? The wavelengths are stretched because space itself is stretching — not merely a classical Doppler effect in a fixed space. “Fossil radiation” — the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a thermal relic of the young universe\nPrediction (1948): Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman (with George Gamow) predicted a radiation field of a few kelvins, released when the universe became transparent ~380,000 years after the beginning. Discovery (1965): Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson detected an isotropic microwave “noise” at ≈ 2.7 K, exactly as predicted. Precision measurements: The COBE satellite (1989–1992) measured an almost perfect blackbody spectrum (2.725 K) and tiny anisotropies (~10⁻⁵). WMAP and then Planck mapped the fluctuation spectrum (acoustic peaks), allowing precise estimates of the universe’s age, matter content, curvature, and more. Why this is crucial: These tiny temperature variations are the seeds that, under gravity, grew into galaxies and clusters. Light-element abundances — the young universe’s “chemical recipe”\nWhen? From ~1 second to ~3 minutes after the Big Bang, temperatures exceeded 10⁹ K. Protons and neutrons fused primarily into helium-4 (≈ 24–25% by mass), with a little deuterium (~few × 10⁻⁵), helium-3, and lithium-7. What we observe: In nearly pristine environments — quasi-primordial gas clouds and ancient, metal-poor stars — measured abundances match the calculations of primordial nucleosynthesis remarkably well. A mild “lithium tension” remains: observed Li-7 is lower than the predicted value. Why it matters: This specific mix can arise only in a very hot, dense universe for a short window of time. An eternal steady-state universe would not yield these proportions. Cosmic Inflation: a Key Hypothesis (Still Under Test)\r#\rIn the 1980s, physicist Alan Guth introduced cosmic inflation: a phase of exponential expansion around 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³² seconds after the Big Bang, during which the universe’s volume grew by an enormous factor.\nWhy propose such an idea? Because the classical Big Bang struggles with several puzzles:\nHorizon problem: Without inflation, widely separated regions of today’s universe could never have been in contact — yet they share nearly identical properties, like temperature. Inflation explains this uniformity: before the extreme expansion, these regions were close enough to exchange information and energy. Flatness problem: Observations show that the universe is nearly flat (neither positively nor negatively curved). Without inflation, that would require extraordinarily precise initial conditions. Inflation acts as a flattening mechanism, driving space toward flatness on large scales. Monopole (and relic) problem: Grand Unified Theories predict magnetic monopoles produced just after the hot Big Bang. Without inflation, their present-day density would rival that of protons — we should see them everywhere. None has been detected despite intensive searches. Inflation dilutes such relics to undetectable levels. Origin of structure: Inflation also explains why the universe is not perfectly uniform. Tiny quantum fluctuations present before and during inflation were stretched to cosmological scales; these small density variations seeded galaxies and clusters. Inflation is not yet definitively confirmed, but several of its predictions have left fingerprints in the CMB, especially in the fluctuation spectrum.\nImplications of the Big Bang Theory\r#\rIn summary, the Big Bang model describes a universe emerging from an extremely hot, dense state — perhaps even a singularity in the sense of general relativity — followed by rapid expansion, with an inflationary phase potentially amplifying that initial growth. At such energies, general relativity and quantum mechanics together are insufficient: our description of the “instant zero” remains speculative, pending a theory of quantum gravity.\nThis scenario prevails because it explains a set of converging observations: the measured expansion of galaxies, the CMB and its blackbody spectrum, the primordial light-element abundances, and the emergence of large-scale structure.\nThe question of an absolute beginning, however, goes beyond physics and touches philosophy. Many scientists and thinkers, regardless of conviction, have expressed discomfort with a sharp beginning. Arthur Eddington, for example, wrote: “Philosophically, the notion of a beginning of the present order of Nature is repugnant to me.”\nWhy the resistance? Because for many, admitting a beginning suggests the existence of a first cause or a creative force. Section 3.3 will explore this link between a cosmic beginning and the idea of a first cause.\nAlternative Theories\r#\rDifferent alternatives to the Big Bang were proposed to restore an eternal universe.\nThe steady-state model was developed by British astronomer Fred Hoyle and colleagues in the 1940s. It posited an infinite, eternal universe while acknowledging expansion. To compensate for dilution as space expands, the model proposed continuous creation of matter, thereby avoiding any dense, hot primordial phase. For a time, this framework rivaled the Big Bang. It fell into disfavor mainly after the discovery of the CMB, which the steady-state model does not naturally explain.\nOther competing models have been proposed:\nCyclic Universe (Big Bounce)\r#\rGeneral idea:\nThe bounce model2 proposes that our universe did not arise from a single Big Bang, but from an infinite series of oscillations: phases of expansion followed by contraction, repeated on cosmic timescales. In the distant past, the universe would have been far larger than it is today, then contracted over billions of years down to an extremely small — but never zero — size. Instead of collapsing into a singularity, it “bounced” and began a new expansion: the phase we observe today. In this framework the cosmos has no beginning and no end, existing from eternity.\nTheoretical versions:\nIn loop quantum gravity, quantum-modified equations replace the singularity with a natural bounce once a critical density is reached. In some string-theoretic scenarios (ekpyrotic models or cyclic inflation), higher-dimensional membranes (branes) periodically collide, triggering cycles of contraction and expansion. These models sometimes impose a minimum contraction scale on the order of the Planck volume (~4 × 10^-105 m³), below which classical physics no longer applies. Observational status:\nTo date, there is no clear observational signature confirming previous cycles. Researchers hope to find hints in the CMB — e.g., anomalies or circular patterns that might betray a prior phase3. Other ideas include primordial gravitational-wave fossils or distinctive features in large-scale structure, but nothing conclusive has been detected so far. As one researcher quoted by Space.com summarized: “There is no empirical evidence today for bouncing cosmologies. But there is also no evidence for the initial singularity.”4 Theoretical limits and critiques2:\nLack of empirical evidence: avoiding the initial singularity is appealing, but the bounce remains a “radical,” highly speculative hypothesis5. Less compelling than inflation: cosmic inflation remains the dominant framework because it robustly explains several puzzles (flatness, homogeneity, absence of magnetic monopoles, the observed CMB fluctuation spectrum). The entropy problem: The second law of thermodynamics requires entropy (overall disorder) to increase from one cycle to the next. Future cycles would thus grow longer and larger; past cycles would have been shorter and smaller. Pushed indefinitely into the past, this logic implies an initial cycle — undermining the claim of an eternal past without beginning. Proposed workarounds (no consensus): Quantum “entropy reset” at the bounce (suggested in some loop-quantum-gravity approaches). Exponential-expansion dilution as in Steinhardt–Turok models, which stretch entropy to near-negligible levels before the next cycle6. Two-arrow time: a bounce producing two opposite directions of time, each with its own increasing entropy. Conformal cyclic cosmology (Penrose): after vast timescales the far-future universe becomes ultra-dilute and radiation-dominated; this “scale-free” state is mathematically equivalent to a new beginning with low initial entropy7.\nThese scenarios are fascinating but remain highly speculative, with no observational confirmation yet. Conclusion:\nThe Big Bounce offers an elegant, stimulating narrative that avoids the initial singularity. Nonetheless, it suffers from a serious lack of empirical support and faces major theoretical hurdles, especially entropy. Even if a bounce occurred, it remains far from clear that it escapes a beginning altogether: the existence of a first cycle or special initial condition still seems hard to avoid.\n\u0026ldquo;Eternal” or “Emergent” Quantum Models\r#\rGeneral idea:\nIn these scenarios, the universe does not “begin” at a strict instant zero. It exists before the Big Bang as a quantum state (quantum vacuum, quasi-stationary state, Euclidean phase, etc.) and then emerges as a classical expanding universe. In other words, the Big Bang is not creatio ex nihilo but a phase transition.\nThe quantum vacuum is not “nothing”:\nIn physics, “vacuum” means a lowest-energy state, roiled by quantum fluctuations that fleetingly create and annihilate particle pairs. This is far from the philosophical “nothing.” These models do not claim that the universe sprang from absolute nothingness.\nCommon variants:\nEmergent universe: the cosmos remains for a very long time in a quasi-stationary quantum state (no true “t = 0”), then gradually enters a classical expansion phase. No-boundary proposal (Hartle–Hawking): there is no initial temporal “edge.” Classical time emerges from a quantum phase described by a wavefunction of the universe, thereby avoiding a singularity. Quantum tunneling (Vilenkin): the universe tunnels from a quantum (metastable vacuum) state into an expanding classical universe. Again, this is a transition, not a leap from absolute nothingness. Limits and observational status:\nThese approaches remain highly speculative. They offer few distinct, easily testable predictions; any signatures tend to overlap with those of the standard model. As of today, no observation decisively selects one of these scenarios.\nConclusions\r#\rDespite their conceptual appeal (eternity, singularity avoidance, etc.), alternative models struggle to reproduce all observations simultaneously. The steady-state model is largely ruled out by the CMB; cyclic/bounce and “eternal” quantum models remain intriguing but lack distinctive, confirmed signatures.\nDiscoveries Leading to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy (Λ)\r#\rSince the late 1970s, it has become clear that a hot, dense Big Bang alone cannot explain everything we observe. In galaxies, stars in the outskirts orbit too fast to be accounted for by luminous matter alone; in clusters, the mass inferred from galaxy motions, hot X-ray gas, and gravitational lensing far exceeds the visible mass. On cosmological scales, the high-precision CMB maps show that additional matter is needed to form the observed large-scale structure. The simplest solution is to posit an additional, invisible component that was dynamically “cold” in the early universe: cold dark matter. It emits little or no light, interacts mainly via gravity, and provides the scaffolding for filaments, galaxies, and clusters.\nThen came the 1998 surprise: distant supernovae appeared dimmer than expected, implying that the universe’s expansion is accelerating. Meanwhile, CMB measurements indicate a nearly flat geometry. Reconciling flatness with accelerated expansion requires a component with negative pressure that drives space to expand faster over time: dark energy, most simply modeled by the cosmological constant Λ. Combining supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the CMB yields a coherent picture: roughly 5% baryons, ~25% cold dark matter, and ~70% dark energy — the ΛCDM model.\nAre there dissenting views? Yes. To replace dark matter, some modify gravity (MOND and extensions like TeVeS): these can fit certain galaxy rotation curves, but struggle with other tests (e.g., cluster dynamics and CMB maps). For dark energy, others alter gravity at large scales (e.g., f(R) theories, back-reaction scenarios) or allow time-evolving dark energy; these avenues are under study but, taken together, do not outperform the simple Λ explanation across all datasets.\nTensions remain — notably the current expansion rate H₀ and the growth of structure (σ₈/S₈). These keep questions open and drive ever-tighter tests of ΛCDM. For now, however, cold dark matter and dark energy remain the most effective ingredients to explain, all at once, internal system dynamics, the universe’s geometry, and its expansion history.\nThe Latest Findings (After Λ and CDM)\r#\rWith ΛCDM in place, cosmology entered an era of high-precision measurement. CMB maps — first with WMAP and especially with Planck — refined key parameters (age, matter/energy content, near-zero curvature) and confirmed the model’s overall coherence. Ground-based experiments like ACT and SPT extended these measurements to smaller angular scales, providing independent checks and complementary constraints.\nIn parallel, large galaxy surveys have revealed the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations, a true standard ruler for reconstructing the expansion history. Combined with weak gravitational lensing (KiDS, DES, HSC), these 3D maps have tracked the growth of structure, tested gravity on large scales, and strengthened the picture of a universe structured by cold dark matter. More recently, the James Webb Space Telescope has found very early galaxies — sometimes more massive or luminous than expected — prompting refinements to models of star formation and galaxy assembly, without overturning the standard framework.\nThese advances have not erased all questions. The value of H₀ differs depending on whether it is measured locally (Cepheids + supernovae, masers, strong lenses) or inferred from the CMB under ΛCDM; likewise, some indicators of structure growth hint at a mild tension. Such discrepancies may reflect still-uncontrolled systematics, or they may point to new physics. Upcoming datasets — DESI (underway), Euclid, and soon the Rubin Observatory — should clarify the magnitude of these tensions and, depending on the outcome, either bolster the model or guide its evolution.\nWhat Next?\r#\rThe current cosmological model is not fixed in stone: it is built from available data, makes quantitative predictions, and is tested by new observations. When results fail to fit, the model is revised. This cycle — observe → model → predict → test → revise — lies at the heart of progress in cosmology.\nObserve → Model. Early expansion measurements led to a dynamic universe; plasma physics in the primordial era suggested a hot, dense state. Model → Predict. Before 1965, a microwave fossil background was predicted — and later detected by Penzias \u0026amp; Wilson. In the 1980s, inflation was introduced to solve horizon/flatness problems; it predicts nearly scale-invariant, adiabatic, (quasi)-Gaussian fluctuations, later confirmed by WMAP/Planck. In 1998, Type Ia SNe revealed acceleration: Λ (dark energy) was added; BAO, CMB, and lensing converged on a consistent parameter set. Test → Revise. Today, tensions (H₀, σ₈/S₈) and surprises (very early, bright JWST galaxies) drive refinements in astrophysics and analysis — or motivate extensions of the standard framework if needed. Knowledge evolves: the model adjusts in light of the best data. Takeaway: ΛCDM is a predictive tool that has passed many tests (expansion, CMB, BAO, light elements, structures), yet it remains revisable. Precisely because it makes sharp predictions, it can be confirmed — or challenged — and thus improved.\nEvery model rests on assumptions. To assess how far ΛCDM applies, and where it must be adjusted, those assumptions should be made explicit and tested.\nUnderlying Assumptions As Jean-Philippe Uzan notes in POUR LA SCIENCE No. 5218, cosmologists build the Big Bang model upon a set of assumptions that should be continually scrutinized. As measurements become more precise, are these assumptions — and the model itself — still adequate for interpreting observations? Should some be dropped or modified? Remember: any model is a working tool, a temporary consensus — necessarily limited and open to revision.\nStepping back, four major assumptions stand out, which we label H1–H4:\nH1: Gravity is accurately described by general relativity.\nMathematically, spacetime geometry is determined by Einstein’s equations. H2: Matter and its non-gravitational interactions (electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear) are described by the Standard Model of particle physics, grounded in quantum physics. H3: The universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.\nWe do not occupy a special place (Copernican principle); the portion we observe is representative of the whole. H3 sets the local geometry of the universe: spatial matter distribution is homogeneous, expansion is the same in all directions and at all points — though it may change over time. H4: The universe has no exotic large-scale structure beyond what has been observed.\nNo extreme inhomogeneities/an-isotropies or exotic topology dominating on scales larger than currently detected. These are not absolute truths; they must be constantly tested against new observations. Like any scientific model, the Big Bang framework will evolve. For now, it remains the most coherent and predictive theory for explaining the universe we observe, even if it exhibits internal limits and tensions (e.g., the Hubble constant and the nature of dark energy).\nConclusions\r#\rTwo principal features of the observable universe are its large-scale homogeneity and isotropy and its expansion. Cosmology’s aim is to propose a model that describes such a universe and explains the structures that formed within it. At present, the Big Bang model is the best way to organize, coherently and rationally, the knowledge we have amassed about the universe and its history, and it is confirmed by the most recent observations.\nThe atheist philosopher Antony Flew commented on this point (in There Is a God: How the World’s Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind 9):\nIt is now widely accepted that the universe had a beginning. This is something that seems to support the claim that the universe was brought into existence by a creative intelligence. As a philosopher, I find this conclusion deeply troubling. For a long time, it was convenient to assume that the universe had always existed. But the Big Bang theory has changed that. It now seems that the cosmologists are proving what Saint Thomas tried to prove philosophically — that the universe had a beginning. — Anthony Flew \u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 3.

Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?","content":" 3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past? Another argument for a beginning of time and the universe rests on a mathematical intuition: the past cannot be infinite, because it would be impossible to cross such an infinity and arrive at the present moment.\nPotential Infinity vs. Actual Infinity\r#\rIt is important to distinguish two fundamental notions of infinity:\nPotential infinity: a quantity that can increase without bound but is always finite at each stage. For example, counting 1, 2, 3… without ever reaching an “infinite number.” In mathematics this corresponds to the concept of a limit, where a value tends toward infinity without ever attaining it.\nActual infinity: a completed infinite totality, existing all at once, such as the set of all natural numbers. This kind of infinity can contain a proper subset of the same size (for example, the natural numbers and the even numbers can be matched one-to-one). Unlike potential infinity, an actual infinity is not built by successive additions but is given in its entirety.\nThis distinction is crucial for thinking about an infinite past: is it a potential infinity (the past extends without limit but is never complete), or an actual infinity (the past is a completed, infinite sequence of events)?\nWhy an Actual Infinite Past Cannot Be Crossed\r#\rThe argument can be framed as follows:\nIf time extended infinitely into the past, then the past would consist of an infinite series of events. Such a series would be actually infinite, not merely potentially infinite. But a series formed by successive addition cannot be actually infinite. The temporal sequence of past events has in fact been formed by successive addition, event after event. Therefore, the past cannot be an actual infinity stretching infinitely backward. Conclusions\r#\rIf we adopt a dynamic view of time — in which time genuinely “flows” — then an infinite past is impossible. While an actual infinity might be conceivable in a static view (where all events are laid out simultaneously, as in a “block universe”), it becomes incoherent when we consider the real, successive passage of time.\nEven if actual infinities exist in some sense, the dynamic nature of time prevents an infinite sequence of past events from being crossed to reach the present.\nIn short: the real passage of time rules out an infinite past, since such an infinity would make the present unattainable. The logical conclusion is that time had an absolute beginning.\nFurther Reading\r#\rAlan Rhoda, On Traversing an Actually Infinite Past, 2006.\n👉 http://alanrhoda.net/blog/2006/05/on-traversing-actually-infinite-past.html\nMorita, Kunihisa. “Time Does Not Pass if Time Began from an Infinite Past,” KRITERION – Journal of Philosophy, vol. 36, no. 3–4, 2022, pp. 291–302.\n👉 https://doi.org/10.1515/krt-2022-0001\nAristotle, Physics, Book III — distinction between potential and actual infinity.\n\u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 3.1 The Big Bang Theory and Alternative Models SUIVANT 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? \u0026gt; "},{"id":8,"href":"/aff1/section3/","title":"3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?","section":"3. Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?","content":" 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? In the previous sections, we saw that the universe very likely had a beginning. Whether through the Big Bang theory or the impossibility of crossing an infinite regress of past events, all evidence suggests that the cosmos is not eternal in the past.\nWe are therefore faced with a profound and dizzying question:\nWhy is there something rather than nothing?\nIf the universe began to exist, then something outside the universe must have caused that beginning. This brings us to the Kalām Cosmological Argument, revitalized in modern philosophy by William Lane Craig.\nThe Kalām Argument\r#\rThe argument can be summarized in three steps:\nEverything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause. William Lane Craig, The Kalām Cosmological Argument, 1979.\nThe conclusion is straightforward: the universe cannot be the cause of its own existence. It must therefore depend on a first cause — one that is independent of time, space, and matter.\nIn the Kalām argument, points (1) and (2) serve as the premises (or axioms; see Chapter 2). We have already examined two arguments supporting the idea that the universe had a beginning. But what about the first premise?\nThe first pillar of the Kalām argument claims that everything that begins to exist must have a cause. At first glance, this seems obvious, even trivial — but it deserves a closer look, since it has been the source of significant debate in both philosophy and physics.\n✅ Arguments in Favor of the Premise\r#\rUniversal Experience of Reality\nIn all our ordinary experience, things never appear without a reason. Whenever an object, a sound, or a phenomenon manifests, our natural impulse is to look for its cause. This is not superstition — it is the very foundation of rational and scientific inquiry.\nImagine a sphere suddenly appearing in the middle of an empty room. Would we accept that it “just appeared,” without origin or reason? Such an answer would offend our deepest intuition of reason.\nNothingness Cannot Produce Anything\n“Nothing” is not an empty physical vacuum — it is the total absence of being, properties, or potential. And what has no properties cannot cause anything. Causality is therefore not just an empirical rule, but a logical necessity: being cannot arise from absolute nonbeing.\nNo Conclusive Counterexamples\nTo date, no observed phenomenon has ever truly emerged from nothing. Even apparently random quantum events — decays, vacuum fluctuations — occur within a preexisting physical context governed by laws. They are not examples of creation ex nihilo.\n❌ Objections to the Premise\r#\rQuantum Phenomena Might Be Uncaused\nIn quantum mechanics, certain events — such as radioactive decay — appear to occur without a determinable cause. This could seem to challenge the universality of causation.\nHowever, these events do not arise from nothing: they occur within a structured vacuum and follow probabilistic laws. They illustrate indeterministic causality, not the absence of causality.\nThe Empiricist Critique of Causation (Hume)\nThe philosopher David Hume argued that causation is not a rational necessity but a habit of thought. We observe regularities, but we never directly perceive a causal link. Therefore, claiming that every beginning must have a cause would be a psychological inference rather than a logically necessary truth.\nThe Ambiguity of “Beginning”\nSome objects or phenomena — mountains, clouds, waves — have beginnings that are hard to define. Extending this ambiguity to the universe itself could make the concept of a “beginning” problematic.\nCan the Principle Apply to the Universe Itself?\nThe universe is not an object within a larger framework — it includes all space, time, and physical laws. Can we therefore apply to the universe the very principles that operate within it? Some argue that causality, like time, might not exist “before” the universe.\nThe Problem of Causality Beyond Time\nCausation presupposes a “before” and “after.” If time did not exist before the universe, then the very concept of a “cause” becomes unclear. Can we meaningfully speak of a cause outside of time?\nIn Summary\r#\rDespite the objections, the premise that everything that begins to exist has a cause remains, in my view, reasonably well-founded. It rests on a long philosophical tradition, on our constant experience of the world, and on the logical impossibility that something could emerge from absolute nothingness.\nThe objections, though serious, do not disprove the premise — they only question its application to extreme domains such as the origin of the universe itself.\nThe Kalām Cosmological Argument does not claim to prove everything one might believe about God. But it offers a powerful rational pathway toward the existence of a creative agent at the origin of the universe.\n\u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 3.2 Is It Possible to Cross an Infinite Past?

Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?","content":" 3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause We have seen that if the universe began to exist, and if everything that begins to exist has a cause, it logically follows that the universe has a cause.\nBut what kind of cause could account for the very existence of everything that exists? A philosophical analysis of the necessary conditions for such a cause reveals several essential properties:\nA Non-Physical Cause\nThe cause of the universe cannot be physical or material, for the simple reason that matter itself began to exist with the universe.\nIf matter has a beginning, its cause cannot be composed of what it brings into being. The cause must therefore be immaterial, independent of particles, fields, or physical laws.\nThis rules out a purely naturalistic or materialistic explanation for the origin of the universe — nature cannot bring itself into existence.\nA Timeless Cause\nAccording to current cosmological models (general relativity, the standard model), time itself begins with the universe.\nThis implies that the cause of the universe must exist beyond time: it is eternal, or at least timeless prior to creation.\nSuch a cause is not subject to the succession of moments or the passage of time — it exists in a state of eternal simultaneity.\nAn Extremely Powerful Cause\nBringing an entire universe into existence — containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars — requires unimaginable power.\nEven if this cause acted only once (at the moment of creation), the magnitude of such an act surpasses anything we can observe or conceive.\nThis is not a relative or mechanical kind of power (measurable energy or force), but ontological power — the ability to bring being forth from nonbeing.\nA Personal or Intentional Cause\nThis is one of the most debated aspects: did the cause of the universe act intentionally?\nSome philosophers (notably William Lane Craig) argue that only a will can produce a temporal effect from a timeless cause.\nAn impersonal cause, such as a physical law, produces its effects necessarily and eternally — if the conditions are met, the effect follows automatically.\nYet in the case of the universe, we see an effect (the Big Bang) that has a definite beginning, while its cause would have existed timelessly.\nWhy did the universe begin 13.8 billion years ago, rather than much earlier — or never at all?\nThe best explanation is that there was a decision to create — which implies intelligence and will.\nBy reasoning logically from the beginning of the universe, we are led to conceive of a cause that is: Immaterial Timeless Infinitely powerful Intentional or personal \u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 3.3 Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing? SUIVANT 3.5 Conclusions \u0026gt; "},{"id":10,"href":"/aff1/section5/","title":"3.5 Conclusions","section":"3. Did the universe have a beginning — and if so, does it have a cause?","content":" 3.5 Conclusions Today, the Big Bang model remains the most successful scientific explanation of the origin and evolution of the universe.\nIt aligns with the major observations — from the cosmic microwave background to the abundance of light elements and the formation of large-scale structures.\nIt is therefore neither irrational nor scientifically unfounded to think that the universe had a beginning — an origin point about 13.8 billion years ago, characterized by an extremely hot and dense state.\nFrom both philosophical and mathematical perspectives, the idea of an actually infinite past presents serious difficulties: a truly infinite sequence of successive events could never be crossed step by step — yet we have clearly reached the present.\nThis suggests that time had a beginning and that the series of past events is not infinite. On this basis, we can state as Axiom 2 that the universe began to exist.\nWe have also examined why it is reasonable to think that “everything that begins to exist has a cause” — our Axiom 1.\nIt rests on the widely accepted principle of causality: we never observe realities coming into being without prior conditions.\nIn both everyday experience and scientific practice, beginnings — births, transformations, phase transitions — occur when certain causes and constraints are present.\nLogically, self-causation is incoherent (what begins cannot cause itself), and circular causation explains nothing.\nQuantum phenomena do not invalidate this framework: the “physical vacuum” is not nothing, and random processes (such as radioactive decay) still unfold according to laws and prior physical states.\nBy accepting these two axioms, the conclusion of the Kalām Cosmological Argument1 naturally follows: the universe has a cause. This cause cannot belong to the universe itself, since it is the origin of the universe. It must therefore be immaterial, timeless, immensely powerful, and intentional. In other words, it possesses the attributes of a first cause.\nFinally, it is worth invoking Occam’s razor2: when two explanations account equally well for the data, the simpler one — that which introduces the fewest extra assumptions — is to be preferred. This principle is sometimes invoked against the idea of a first cause, but it applies just as well to it: competing cosmological models that multiply unverified hypotheses (for example, certain bounce scenarios requiring ad hoc mechanisms for entropy reset) are far less parsimonious. Until robust observations demand otherwise, the standard framework — the Big Bang, possibly preceded by an inflationary phase and described by ΛCDM — remains the most economical and predictive description available. If future data were to contradict it, it should of course be revised accordingly: such is the nature of knowledge, which advances through explicit hypotheses, testable predictions, and constant confrontation with observation.\nIn summary:\nAxiom 1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\nAxiom 2: The universe began to exist.\nStatement 1: Since the universe had a beginning, it therefore depends on a cause external to itself — an uncreated, immaterial, timeless, supremely powerful, and intentional reality. This reality constitutes the first cause of everything that exists.\n\u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 3.4 A Philosophical Portrait of the First Cause SUIVANT 4.

Is There Anything After Death?","content":"6.1 Near-Death Experience and Shared Death Experience Raymond Moody, a physician and philosopher, initially had no interest in spiritual phenomena. Coming from a rational and skeptical background, he described himself as a materialist: he believed consciousness was solely a product of the brain, and that death marked the absolute end of existence. He therefore had no particular expectation of an afterlife. Everything changed in the 1960s, while he was still a philosophy student. Moody met psychiatrist Dr. George Ritchie, who told him about an incident during which he believed he had traveled to the afterlife while he was dead for nearly nine minutes at the age of 20 (Ritchie later recounted this experience in his book Return From Tomorrow, published in 1978). Moody began documenting similar accounts from other people who had experienced clinical death and discovered that many of these experiences shared common features, such as the sensation of leaving the body, passing through a tunnel, meeting deceased relatives, and seeing a radiant light. The more he heard, the more he was struck by the consistency of these narratives coming from people of very different backgrounds—sometimes atheists, sometimes believers—often profoundly changed upon their return.\nIn 1975, he published Life After Life, in which he popularized for the first time the term “Near-Death Experience,” a groundbreaking book in which he gathered and analyzed more than 150 testimonies from people who had undergone an NDE. Clinical, philosophical, and accessible, it became a worldwide bestseller. It marked a turning point in research on consciousness and death.\nImage by Ehabich Thus, far from being motivated by religious faith, it was the empirical observation of these extraordinary accounts—their psychological power and their recurrence—that led Moody to consider the possibility that death might not be an end, but a passage.\nYears later, he broadened his research with Glimpses of Eternity (2010), focusing this time on a related but lesser-known phenomenon: shared death experiences (SDEs), lived not by the dying themselves, but by their loved ones present at the moment of death.\nHis method relies on a rigorous qualitative approach: detailed interviews, cross-checking of accounts, and thematic analysis. He does not seek to prove a religious or materialist thesis, but to document universal human experiences with seriousness, taking into account the cultural, spiritual, and social diversity of witnesses.\nClassic near-death experience (NDE) narrative In Life After Life, Raymond Moody identifies 15 recurring elements found in many NDE accounts:\n1. Being pronounced dead\nThe person hears someone (often a doctor) officially declare their death.\n2. An unpleasant sound\nThey perceive a loud noise, a buzzing, or an uncomfortable ringing.\n3. Rapid movement through a dark tunnel\nThe person feels as if they are being pulled very rapidly through some kind of dark space. Many different words are used to describe this space: a tunnel, a cave, a well, a trough, an enclosure, a funnel, a void, an abyss, a conduit, a valley, or a cylinder.\n4. Out-of-body experience\nThey suddenly find themselves outside their physical body, while remaining in their immediate environment.\n5. Observing their own body from the outside\nThey see their body from a distance, like an external spectator, and witness attempts at resuscitation.\n6. Intense emotional state\nThey are deeply shaken emotionally by the experience.\n7. Gradual adjustment to the new condition\nThey regain composure and begin to get used to this non-physical “body” and its different capabilities.\n8. Encountering other beings\nOthers come to meet them to help, including the spirits of deceased loved ones.\n9. Appearance of a benevolent being of light\nA luminous, warm, and unknown being appears, embodying a loving and powerful presence.\nIt first appears faintly, then becomes indescribably brilliant, without ever dazzling or impairing vision. All describe this light as a conscious being, with a distinct personality. From it emanate an extraordinary love and warmth that envelop the person and make them feel totally accepted and at peace. They feel an irresistible magnetic attraction toward it. Identification varies according to beliefs: most people with a Christian background identify the light as Christ or an angel; others describe it simply as a “being of light.” Shortly after appearing, it communicates directly—through a clear and immediate transfer of thought, without words or sounds—making misunderstanding or deception impossible. 10. Non-verbal communication and introspection\nThis being asks a question without words, inviting reflection on one’s life.\nAmong the formulations reported by Moody: “Are you ready to die?”, “What have you done with your life to show me?”, and “What have you done with your life that is enough?” Witnesses insist that, although the question has a deep emotional impact, it is not asked in a spirit of condemnation. They continue to feel the love and total acceptance emanating from the light, whatever their answer. The purpose seems rather to prompt reflection—to help them articulate and understand. In a sense, it is a Socratic question: not asked to obtain information, but to help the person progress toward truth. 11. Panoramic life review\nThey instantly see a summary of major events of their life, with deep understanding. This episode is often described as intense and overwhelming.\nThis review is characterized by several elements:\nExtreme speed, comparable to a flash, while still allowing deep and detailed understanding. A chronological flow, from early childhood to the present moment, sometimes with back-and-forth movements depending on emotional significance. Three-dimensional visualization: memories are not just images or thoughts, but replay as immersive, living scenes, sometimes with sounds, smells, and physical sensations. An external point of view: the person may observe as a spectator, or even experience events through the eyes of others involved, feeling their emotions and perceiving the impact of their own actions on them. Variable content: for some, the review includes their entire life down to the smallest details; for others, only the most significant moments or those with particular moral weight. An educational and transformative purpose: the retrospective seems designed to awaken awareness of how words and actions affect others. The goal is not to judge or condemn, but to foster understanding and encourage spiritual growth. Witnesses often emphasize that this experience is accompanied by a sense of unconditional love emanating from a luminous presence or spiritual being who gently guides them through the process.\n12. Approaching a boundary or barrier\nThey come near a symbolic limit between earthly life and the beyond.\n13. The need to return to earthly life\nThey realize they must return because their time to die has not yet come.\n14. Resistance to returning\nThey refuse to return, drawn by the peace, joy, and love they feel in that state.\n15. Re-entry and post-experience difficulties\nThey return to their physical body, try to describe the experience, but lack words and face skepticism—often leading them to stay silent—even though their view of life and death is profoundly changed.\nNote: It is important to remember that the narrative presented above does not correspond to any specific individual’s experience. It is rather a “model,” a compilation of common elements found across many testimonies. No one necessarily experiences all of these elements, and their order may vary slightly.\nThe internet is full of near-death experience testimonies. Here are a few:\n1. Bill Tortorella Bill Tortorella recounts his near-death experience after contracting a virus at a jewelry trade show in Tucson, Arizona. During his encounter “on the Other Side,” he describes transforming into a beautiful beam of light, being guided by three guardian angels, reuniting with his deceased brother, and receiving revelations about our origins and our purpose. Bill describes what it felt like to be back in his true home “on the Other Side,” and how the love and forgiveness he experienced changed the way he lived afterward.\n\u0026ldquo;I left my body to this beautiful fluorescent glowing mist, hovering over my body, looking down upon myself and when I recognized that body wasn\u0026rsquo;t alive anymore, this beam came from behind me so bright. It let up everything underneath me and it drew me right into the gateway, this beautiful tunnel. The tunnel was made up of magnificent colors and now I am starting to move but I\u0026rsquo;m feeling this amazing feeling. I have a feeling like I never had before. A love. The love was so incredible that you actually become the love. Now you\u0026rsquo;re in this light, you\u0026rsquo;re part of this this light and I\u0026rsquo;m moving at what seems to me like the speed of light, no debris, no nothing, just light, beautiful colors whizzing by me, going through me and this love is growing stronger and stronger. By the time I get to my destination I remember distinctively saying I\u0026rsquo;m home, I\u0026rsquo;m finally home. I remember hearing a soft voice speak to me and she says yes Bill you\u0026rsquo;re home in the light of God and then she says my name is Antonia, I am one of your Guardians and now I\u0026rsquo;m being greeted by Spirits all around me, family, friends that I remember mingling, talking, feeling love from everybody. I recognize them, they recognize me. It\u0026rsquo;s all, everything is done through telepathy. There\u0026rsquo;s no mouths at this point. There\u0026rsquo;s no bodies at this point. You\u0026rsquo;re just they beams of light. I\u0026rsquo;m still a Mist at this time after it seemed like a few minutes have passed by and I hear this voice: hello Billy. When I heard that voice that was my brother\u0026rsquo;s voice. [\u0026hellip;] then he explained to me that he has to take me now and that we were going for something and I said \u0026ldquo;what?\u0026rdquo;. He says we\u0026rsquo;re going for Your Life review. […] They showed me all the good I\u0026rsquo;ve done in my life, they showed me all the wrong I have ever done in my life. Luckily, thank God, I always say, thank God, I never really felt like I really did anything really really bad but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know the hurt I caused some people but you get to feel that pain, you get to feel that hurt that you put on to others. You become the physical pain and I was I was physically crying in my spirit but no no body but it\u0026rsquo;s like I felt the tears. It mounted it, mounted it, mounted so bad. I said I can\u0026rsquo;t take it anymore please forgive me. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry and all of a sudden a light came in and said now we\u0026rsquo;ll show you the good side. \u0026ldquo;\nFull testimony link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=968KcfXhURQ\n2. Erica Tait (an atheist before her NDE) In 2015, Erica Tait, a psychotherapist from New Jersey, nearly died after falling 18 meters from a cliff during a solo hike. During the seven hours she was trapped and injured, she reports having a profound near-death experience that transformed her understanding of life, death, and meaning. She describes a shift from a traumatized atheist struggling with dependence to a person awakened spiritually, committed to compassion, healing, and service.\n\u0026ldquo;The first thing I remember is separating from my physical body and so I remember looking at my body and recognizing that I am not that. There\u0026rsquo;s something separate from my physical being and in that I learned that I don\u0026rsquo;t die, that there actually is no death. There\u0026rsquo;s something that actually survives death and some people can call that a soul or a spirit or consciousness but that was really profound because at the time, all I ever believed in was what I could sense with my five senses but this was proof that there\u0026rsquo;s actually something more than just the physical. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;And from there I had what many people call a life review and so it was in a flash where in the state I was there was almost like there was no time. So in a flash, I saw my entire life flash before my eyes and I grew up with a lot of childhood trauma and I struggled with addiction. I was really just like a sick and wounded human at the time and a huge atheist and what I saw in my life review was that I was actually causing more harm to those around me than I was actually relieving the suffering or living in alignment with my soul\u0026rsquo;s purpose and you know that saying that: hurt people hurt people. So I saw very clearly that my own suffering was then unconsciously being transmitted to all those around me and that was very eye opening. I believe that\u0026rsquo;s what we would call karma. I learned about karma and cause and effect and how it determines where we go next and how deeply it affects the people, not just ourselves and our own soul journey but also the people all the people around us. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;And it was interesting because there was no one judging me as good or bad, except for myself, the most objective version of myself. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t judgmental or shameful. It was more like an honest assessment of like: you\u0026rsquo;re just not living in alignment and so that was hard to see but also really important and has created, really created a huge heart expansion in me like deep compassion for the suffering in the world but also a deep understanding of what our true purpose is here around, how like earth is actually a school and karma or what I learned as these like lessons or these decisions and every action is here to teach us so that we\u0026rsquo;re living more in alignment with our soul\u0026rsquo;s purpose eventually to fully embody love. […] \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s that I experienced what many people would call God so and that was my experience with the white light which some people would call God or maybe just ultimate consciousness or the spirit but it taught me about how it is everything and it was the most incredible unspeakable amount of love and peace I have ever experienced there\u0026rsquo;s like no words to describe that state and the wisdom that came from being in that energy was tremendous as well. I learned that it makes up everything on the whole planet, that every single cell, every atom in matter is created by this one energy and that we\u0026rsquo;re actually all just one thing, we are all fully connected and because we are all one there actually is no separation and no death.\u0026rdquo;\nFull testimony link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igN4sFp79b8\n3. Nancy Rynes Nancy Rynes reports had a near-death experience during surgery after being hit by a car while cycling. During her time “on the other side,” Nancy describes an experience in a spiritual realm where she met a guide who showed her the interconnectedness of all things. This revelation helped her become aware of the impact of her actions on others. After returning to her body, she struggled to integrate the experience into daily life. But she eventually chose a path of spiritual awakening through practices like meditation and gratitude.\nToday, she supports others in their own spiritual journeys, emphasizing that the essential purpose of life is learning to live in love and compassion. Her testimony highlights the transformative power of NDEs and the importance of seeking spiritual understanding at the very heart of life’s trials.\nHere are the main points of her testimony:\n1. Awakening in a different realm\n“I woke up and what I’m looking around at is this beautiful hillside… sort of like in a meadow… looking out over a series of rolling mountain ranges.”\n“The first thing I noticed was this wave of Peace… it felt like I was being hugged… there was this big moment of feeling acceptance and really just unconditional love coming into me.”\n2. Realization that she is dead and there is something after death\n“Oh my God, I died.” “I thought: I must have died on the operating table.” “But then I thought: wait a minute… if I died, what’s all this? Because first of all, I don’t believe in anything. And second, my parents told me that I’m going to go to hell because I’m an atheist. But I’m not experiencing either one of those.” “That’s when I really began to wonder what the heck was going on and why I am here.”\n3. Encounter with a guide\n“All of a sudden I saw someone kind of materialize out of fog. She was very ephemeral, vaguely human… I was never able to see her face because it wasn’t about her; it was about me learning what I needed to learn.”\n“It’s time for you to learn what you need to learn in order to go back and make your life one that would be worth living.”\n4. Learning her life’s purpose\n“You’ve already agreed to go back.”\n“You did that before you were born into your life.”\n“She showed me me planning my life before I was born.”\n“The place that you are in now is not the Ultimate Reality of where you’re going to go… here what we do is we’re making this an environment that is comfortable for you to learn in.”\n5. Seeing the paths of her life\n“All around me I saw the map of my life… there were these different pathways I could see from one end of the map to the other.”\n“It’s not like there’s a particular right path that you need to be on.”\n“Balance those two out so that you’re making decisions from a really holistic place rather than simply an analytical decision.”\n6. Experiencing a life review\n“She said well I want you to kneel down by the side of the pond and just touch the surface of the pond… when I would focus on one [moment], I was back in it… experiencing it again from my perspective but also experiencing it from the other people and I could feel everything they felt as if it was mine.”\n“Everything that you do has an impact and therefore be more conscious of how you impact others.”\n7. Being sent back\n“She laid hands on my shoulder… and then she sort of sent me back.”\n“For the vast majority of souls that come here to have a life experience… they consider this nearly life but not real life.”\n“The core purpose that we all share is to learn how to be here in this environment and still live from a place of love and compassion—not just for your immediate family but for everybody else.”\nFull testimony link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZfaPCwjguk\n4. Elmira Strange (Muslim) In 2012, Elmira Strange underwent emergency surgery that saved her life due to ulcerative colitis… and she crossed the threshold between life and death.\nAt that moment—somewhere between this world and the other—she reports what can only be described as a near-death experience (NDE). She found herself in a realm filled with light, bliss, and unconditional love. A being of light—whom she initially believed to be a spiritual guide—showed her around. He told her something she never forgot:\n✨ “You exist… and that alone is extraordinary. You have nothing to prove to anyone.” ✨\nIt was the deepest and most joyful state she had ever known—a sense of divine presence, peace, and unity that words can barely convey. Years later, she reports encountering the same state during a shamanic ceremony—as if she returned to that same “particle of light.”\nBut today, after returning to Islam, Elmira reflects on the event differently. Was this being of light in fact an angel? Was the realm she visited the Barzakh—the intermediate world where souls enter after death?\n\u0026ldquo;So during the surgery I found myself in a different reality. It\u0026rsquo;s the reality that is filled with light. It\u0026rsquo;s a reality that looked like a corridor with many doors. It\u0026rsquo;s the reality where I wasn\u0026rsquo;t alone. In fact, there was somebody with me on my right side. Somebody was walking with me, some kind of light being, some kind of entity which wasn\u0026rsquo;t a human. But at the same time it was absolutely reassuring like your best friend. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;And that being was telling me about our life on the other side. What we do, how we live and literally even our work there. We teach there, we learn there, we do all kind of things. Life goes on. And this is what he was explaining to me. I feel like it was he rather than she. For some reason I felt it was a masculine energy at that time because I was deeply in new age. I literally thought after that experience I thought it\u0026rsquo;s a spirit guide. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Now from the Islamic perspective I can say that it was some kind of being divine being whether it\u0026rsquo;s angelic being or not I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I know that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a human and I know it was a light being that the being that emanates light, kindness, bliss and so on where you feel reassured where you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re with your best friend and someone who deeply cares about you and we were walking along that corridor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I remember the state of bliss and pure happiness, pure love, pure joy at that point. And I remember that that being said to me basically now your time to go back. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about anything. You are in the right place doing the right thing. And with that I opened my eyes. I was on the table after the surgery in the next room. And when I opened my eyes I knew that the vision was an experience. It was real 100%. It was real. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a hallucination. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t some kind of dream. It was as real as anything. \u0026quot;\nFull testimony link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOlv-VKINZE\nShared Death Experience (SDE) In Glimpses of Eternity, Moody describes a phenomenon related to NDEs: shared death experiences (SDEs). SDEs are reports from non-dying individuals who are present at the death of a loved one and who experience—at the same time—certain typical elements of near-death experiences: out-of-body sensations, intense light, a feeling of peace, visions of the deceased, or perceptions of an “afterlife.”\nFrequently reported elements include:\nOut-of-body sensation: The living witness feels their consciousness leaving the body, sometimes floating above the scene. Perception of a light or tunnel: Some perceive a radiant light, often described as benevolent. Vision of spiritual beings or the deceased: They may “see” the deceased being welcomed or guided. Non-verbal communication: Some report an exchange of emotions or thoughts with the dying person or other entities. Altered time perception: Time seems suspended or slowed. Unity, deep peace, unconditional love: Witnesses describe a sense of transcendence or absolute love. These experiences occur while the witness is in good health, awake, sometimes even while accompanying someone in their final moments in a hospital or at home.\nScott’s testimony In 1981, Scott lost his partner Mary Fran in a car accident that also seriously injured their 7-year-old son, Nolan. During the six days Nolan fought between life and death, family and friends took turns keeping vigil at his bedside. Scott had a private moment with Nolan just before his death, telling him that he could go if he saw his mother.\nAt Nolan’s death, Scott reports a shared death experience: he saw Mary Fran come to take their son. He felt their love-filled reunion, and to his surprise, he was invited to join them. Together, they entered an intense light where he felt a universal love, shared farewells, and found deep peace—while simultaneously remaining aware of his body in the room, sitting near other family members.\nKey quotes from his testimony:\n« Mary Fran came across the veil and scooped him [Nolan] out of his physical body. They had this most exquisite reunion as you could only imagine between a mother and son. »\n« I got to participate in it somehow. I could feel what it is that they were feeling… this joyous reunion. »\n« The two of them then turned to me, came over, and embraced me. Then the three of us left and went into the light. »\n« I felt like I was me… and yet connected to everything in the universe. My focus was with Mary Fran and Nolan. We had a chance to express our love and say our goodbyes. »\n« It wasn’t like ‘time to say goodbye’; it felt like we were done, like this was good. Then Mary Fran guided Nolan further into the light. »\n« I was with Mary Fran and Nolan in the light… and I was also fully present in the room sitting next to Willie. »\nSee the full testimony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgI9t2KlMlA\nThese testimonies are unsettling, because they seem to suggest that consciousness can exist independently of the biological brain, challenging the idea that NDEs are merely hallucinations produced by a distressed brain.\nProfile of people reporting NDEs and SDEs The accounts collected by Moody come from extremely diverse witnesses, which strengthens the universal character of the phenomenon.\nPeople of all ages, backgrounds, and religions (Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu) or atheists. No necessary link to prior faith. Experiences often followed by an inner transformation: less fear of death, more empathy, and a spiritual search. Some conversions or deepening of faith are reported, but not systematically. The impact of these experiences is often profound, but their interpretation remains personal and free.\nCan science explain these experiences? Yes—part of NDEs/SDEs can be explained through known mechanisms. When the brain lacks oxygen (for example during cardiac arrest), it can produce sensations of tunnel, light, and peace. Certain medications or drugs (such as anesthetics) can create similar experiences: feeling detached from the body, intense well-being, and a sense of unity. Extreme stress, isolation, and sleep deprivation can also trigger confusion, vivid dreams, and mixed memories. It is also known that stimulation of certain brain regions can trigger the illusion of being “above one’s body.” In this reading, consciousness is a product of the brain: if brain activity changes, experience changes; if it stops, consciousness disappears.\nContexts with little sensory reference often produce effects resembling fragments of NDEs/SDEs:\nIn a sensory deprivation (float) tank, many report seeing lights, hearing non-existent sounds, or feeling bodily boundaries dissolve, sometimes with the impression of floating outside the body. In prolonged enclosed environments (polar stations, submarines, space simulations), vivid dreams, time distortion, a sensed presence in the room, or even perceived voices have been observed. With sleep deprivation in a very quiet room, waking hallucinations can occur (light flashes, buzzing, faces), with sensations of floating or doubling. In intensive care, stress, machine noises, and the loss of day/night cues can create intense scenes mixing real perceptions and imagined elements, leaving strong but confused memories. However, not everything is fully covered by these explanations, including the effects of isolation.\nNo medication involved in many cases. Many people report an NDE when no substance known to produce such effects was administered at the time of the event. Medications therefore cannot explain all accounts. Flat EEG and detailed memories. Some patients describe rich, structured memories while their EEG (electroencephalogram, which records the brain’s electrical activity) was flat—indicating no detectable neural activity at the relevant moment. Verifiable perceptions. Some witnesses report perceiving precise details (objects, words, events) during clinical unconsciousness; “chance” or later reconstruction does not always account for the reported accuracy. Insight and lasting impact. Many describe deep realizations (moral clarity, prioritizing others, changing direction) and durable transformations: less fear of death, more altruism, reoriented values. These stable effects are not easily reconciled with brief hallucinations. Shared experiences. Simultaneous SDEs experienced by several loved ones at the same moment show concordance between witnesses that purely individual hallucinations explain poorly. Only partial laboratory “replications.” Lab-induced or substance-induced experiences reproduce fragments (out-of-body sensations, light, unity), but rarely the whole: rich life review, encounters perceived as real, and deep personal transformation. End-of-life brain activity: necessary but not sufficient. Brief “spikes” of activity near death might illuminate certain elements (for example the life review), but they do not explain the coherence, richness, and alleged veridicality of many accounts. In short: science explains several aspects of NDEs very well—lack of oxygen, extreme stress, sensory isolation, effects of certain medications, or perceptual illusions. However, when one examines the full range of testimonies, some elements remain difficult to integrate into these models: detailed narratives reported with flat EEG, verifiable descriptions of external scenes, cross-cultural coherence, and profound personality changes.\nThese elements prove nothing by themselves, but they invite the question to remain open: can consciousness truly be reduced entirely to brain function, or are we encountering phenomena that surpass current models?\nAlthough science has not yet settled the matter, these experiences continue to challenge the materialist paradigm.\nIn an interview with Jeffrey Mishlove (\rhttps://www.intuition.org/txt/moody.htm), Moody shares his personal conclusions about his research on NDEs/SDEs:\nI do not hesitate to say that after speaking with more than a thousand people who have had these experiences, and after personally experiencing on several occasions some of the truly perplexing and unusual aspects of these experiences, it has given me great confidence that there is life after death. In fact, I must honestly confess that I have absolutely no doubt—based on what my patients have told me—that they have had a glimpse of the afterlife. Conclusion After analyzing hundreds of testimonies, Raymond Moody draws several important observations:\n💡 The mind appears to survive physical death.\nNDE accounts suggest the existence of a state of consciousness that persists beyond clinical death.\n🌍 These experiences are universal.\nNDEs occur among people of all ages, cultures, social backgrounds, and religions—including atheists. This suggests they do not depend on a particular belief.\n🔄 They deeply transform individuals.\nPeople who have had an NDE often become more empathetic, altruistic, less materialistic, and no longer fear death.\nWhat stands out is that these experiences profoundly change people morally or spiritually, but do not systematically lead them to convert to a particular religion. Some become more spiritual; others deepen their original faith; others remain agnostic or atheistic but live with more openness or inner peace.\nRaymond Moody does not seek to impose a religious interpretation. His approach remains cautious and philosophical: he does not prove life after death, but he shows that death might not be the end.\nTo go further:\r#\rRaymond Moody’s two books:\nMoody, Raymond A.\nLife After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon — Survival of Bodily Death (1975)\nMoody, Raymond A. \u0026amp; Perry, Paul.\nGlimpses of Eternity: Sharing the Near-Death Experience (2010)\nA few videos to discover or explore Raymond Moody’s work:\nDocumentary “Life After Life” – Raymond Moody\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG4zfeemtEs\nDr. Raymond Moody talks about “Life After Life”\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYuniH2jYRI\n\u0026lt; PREVIOUS 6.

Is There Anything After Death?","content":"6.2 Negative Near-Death Experience Are there people who have experienced a negative near-death experience, close to the traditional image of hell?\nYes. Although positive accounts are by far the most common, there are disturbing testimonies of so-called “negative” NDEs, involving feelings of anguish, isolation, or even damnation. The book Life After Death – Why We Should Believe briefly addresses this topic, citing several studies (Greyson, Bush, Moody).\nThe authors (Chambon and Riffard) point out that:\nThese experiences are very rare (1–5% of cases depending on sources). They are less often shared because they are shameful, traumatic, or poorly understood. They should not be interpreted as punishments, but rather as reflections of the psychological state at the moment of death (fear, resistance, confusion). Sometimes, these NDEs begin in darkness but evolve toward the light after a moment of letting go. They may therefore be understood not as spiritual failures, but as initiatory stages—calls to inner transformation.\nTo better understand them, here are two representative testimonies: that of Nancy Evans Bush (the void) and that of Howard Storm (hell).\nNancy Evans Bush: the existential void\r#\rIn the 1960s, Nancy Evans Bush, a young Christian woman with no serious medical history, underwent a near-death experience under anesthesia. Unlike the luminous accounts, she experienced an absolute void: no identity, no God, no reference points. A cold, endless nothingness.\nI was in the void. And I was… nothing. Forgotten, nonexistent. She describes total annihilation—no fire, no demons, but a radical absence of everything. This experience haunted her for years. For more than 20 years, she told no one about it, fearing she would be seen as insane or isolated.\nhttps://ndestories.org/nancy-evans-bush/ It was only much later, when she discovered the work of Raymond Moody and the IANDS (International Association for Near-Death Studies), that she realized she was not alone. She learned that others had also experienced “dark” NDEs, and she then decided to conduct her own research.\nWith the support of Dr. Bruce Greyson, she explored these minority accounts and became the voice of those who had never been heard: witnesses of negative NDEs.\nTheir profiles are often far from stereotypes:\nsome are moral, religious, or compassionate individuals; others are very rational, attached to control, or going through an unconscious inner crisis. What they seem to share is a form of inner disconnection: fear of letting go, mental rigidity, emotional emptiness.\nThese experiences may be understood as a form of purification or spiritual crisis:\nthey confront the soul with its lack of love or meaning; they force the letting go of false certainties; they trigger a deep inner transformation. Hell may not be a place. It may be a stage—a violent transition that pushes us to let go. In her book Dancing Past the Dark, she identifies three types of negative NDEs:\nthe inverse: the light becomes threatening; the void: total nothingness; hell: visions of fire, screams, dark entities. She insists: these experiences are never final. They are passages, not condemnations.\n📘 Dancing Past the Dark: Distressing Near-Death Experiences, Nancy Evans Bush, Hampton Roads Publishing, 2012 (rev. ed. 2020)\n🎥 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEaiAKaV7w4\nHoward Storm: from hell to light\r#\rHoward Storm was a respected university professor, convinced that consciousness was merely a product of the brain and that death marked the absolute end of existence.\nThe idea of any kind of life after death never even crossed my mind, because I didn’t believe in such things. I was convinced that nothing existed after death. Only naïve people believed in that sort of thing. I believed in neither God, nor heaven, nor hell, nor any of those fairy tales. But in 1985, during a trip to Paris, he suffered a severe intestinal perforation. While awaiting emergency surgery, he lost consciousness and underwent a profoundly disturbing near-death experience.\nhttp://www.howardstorm.com He found himself outside his body, guided by entities through a dark corridor. These beings quickly became hostile and violent. He experienced a scene of hell: solitude, humiliation, psychological suffering. Deep within himself, a voice urged him to pray—again and again. He tried to recall childhood memories from Sunday school or fragments of prayers he had learned, or anything even remotely similar, such as “God Bless America.” This had an effect. The entities retreated.\nAlone, on the edge of despair, he called out to Jesus for help:\nFor the first time in my adult life, I wanted Jesus to be real. I didn’t know how to pray or what to say, but with all the strength I had left, I cried out, “Jesus, please save me.” Immediately, a gentle, loving light burst forth and pulled him out of the darkness. He was welcomed by a presence of peace and love, which he identified as Jesus. This experience of love completely transformed him.\nI knew, with absolute certainty, that God loved me. He asked many questions and received clear answers. Jesus gave him guidance and wisdom:\nYou will find what you are looking for. If you are looking for love, you will find love. If you are looking for hate, you will find hate. What you are within yourself will be reflected back to you. When he begged to remain in this light, God replied:\nYou are not ready to come here yet. You still have things to learn, and you still have work to do in the world. Upon returning to life, he was radically transformed: he left academia, became a Christian, and then a pastor. He devoted his life to sharing this message: love is the purpose of existence, and even at the depths of hell, one can still call out to the light.\n📘 My Descent Into Death: A Second Chance at Life, Howard Storm, Hampton Roads Publishing, 2000\n🎥 https://youtu.be/8TFLL8_Hxts\nConclusion\r#\rWhat if dark experiences were not endings, but beginnings?

Is There Anything After Death?","content":"6.3 Post-Mortem Stages In the book \u0026ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire\u0026rdquo; (i.e. Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed), psychiatrist Olivier Chambon and psychologist Marie-Odile Riffard invite us to rethink death. Far from religious dogma or materialist skepticism, they advocate a rational, scientific approach that remains open to the possibility that consciousness survives the death of the body.\nDrawing on more than 40 years of international research, the authors explore a coherent set of phenomena: near-death experiences (NDEs), out-of-body experiences, post-mortem communications, memories of past lives, and experiences under spiritual hypnosis. These phenomena are not isolated; thousands of cases have been documented, often with methodological rigor and verifiable elements.\nThe aim of the book is not to convince through faith, but to show that the hypothesis of consciousness not reducible to the brain is today far more plausible than classical materialism.\nI read the French edition of the book (La vie après la mort – pourquoi il faut y croire, 2020). It radically changed my view of death. I highly recommend it.\nWhat Happens After Death? – The Major Stages Based on numerous cross-referenced accounts (NDEs, mediumistic communications, spiritual hypnosis, etc.), Chambon and Riffard outline a multi-phase post-mortem process:\nSeparation from the body: As soon as the heart or brain stops, many report a separation of consciousness from the physical body. The person observes the scene from above, hears conversations among the living, and perceives details that are sometimes verifiable. Release and lucidity: A feeling of peace and lightness sets in. Consciousness appears clearer and more expansive, as if freed from the limitations of the brain. Passage through a tunnel or luminous threshold: A tunnel or an intense light appears, described as a loving, conscious, and benevolent presence. This moment often marks the transition to another plane. Life review: Individuals relive their entire life, not in a punitive way but empathically, experiencing the emotions felt by others as a result of their own actions. Encounter with loved ones: Deceased relatives or spiritual guides appear, often to reassure or guide. Some testimonies speak of beings of light transmitting profound wisdom. Return or crossing: In NDEs, the person is often sent back with the message, “It is not your time yet.” For those who cross definitively, the journey continues. Up to this point, the stages are similar to those described by Moody.\nWhat happens after the definitive crossing?\nEarth-proximate phase: For a time, the soul appears to remain close to the living. It may: send signs (sensations, dreams, moved objects), be perceived or contacted without yet realizing it has died, accompany loved ones through their grieving process. This transitional stage may serve as a form of farewell or emotional release.\nTransition to another plane: The soul then “ascends” toward a broader reality, described as luminous, vibrant, and more “real” than our physical world. Different planes of existence are said to exist, depending on the level of consciousness attained.\nIntegration period: The soul enters a phase of learning, rest, and understanding. This may include:\nspiritual guides, symbolic places such as libraries or teaching centers, inner work reflecting on the experiences of the past life. Evolution or reincarnation: Some souls continue their evolution on other planes, while others choose to return to Earth. Reincarnation is presented not as a punishment, but as a choice for growth.\nThousands of children around the world report verified memories of past lives, further supporting this hypothesis.\nFurther Reading and Viewing\r#\rSite des éditions Larousse – Fiche du livre Interview d’Olivier Chambon (YouTube) Conférence : La conscience survit-elle à la mort ? \u0026lt; PRÉCÉDENT 6.2 Negative Near-Death Experience SUIVANT 6.4 Those Who Came Close to Death Tell Their Stories: The Lessons They Received \u0026gt; "},{"id":14,"href":"/NDE/section4/","title":"6.4 Lessons Received","section":"6. Is There Anything After Death?","content":"6.4 Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received Many people who have experienced a near-death experience (NDE) report encountering a being of light, Jesus, or a divine presence of absolute love. These encounters often mark a radical turning point in their understanding of life and the meaning of existence. Below is a synthesis of the recurring teachings, illuminated by powerful testimonies.\n💫 “You Are Loved as You Are”\r#\rThe being of light—whether perceived as God, Jesus, an angel, or a universal presence—welcomes each soul with immeasurable love and complete knowledge of who they are. This love is described as infinite, pure, and nonjudgmental, a deeply unsettling revelation for those who experience it.\nBetty Eadie (Embraced by the Light, 1992):\n“He knew everything about me, my mistakes, my sins, yet He did not judge me. He loved me completely.”\nPam Reynolds (Light and Death, 1998):\n“I was embraced by a presence that felt like God — overwhelming, loving, knowing everything about me and loving me anyway.”\nHoward Storm (My Descent Into Death, 2005):\n“I expected to be judged and condemned, but instead I was welcomed by a warmth and love unlike anything I had ever known.”\nThis discovery profoundly reshapes many people’s view of God: not a merciless judge, but a source of pure love who knows us fully and welcomes us unconditionally.\n🧡 “The Most Important Thing in Life Is to Learn to Love”\r#\rA central message emerging from NDEs is that the ultimate purpose of life is to love and serve others. Love is presented as a fundamental energy that connects all beings.\nHoward Storm (My Descent Into Death, 2005):\n“He told me the purpose of life was to love others and serve God.”\nGeorge Ritchie (Return from Tomorrow, 1978):\n“I felt the question was really: ‘How much have you loved?’”\nBetty Eadie (Embraced by the Light, 1992):\n“He reminded me that the primary purpose of life is to love others.”\nBill Tortorella (\rYouTube video):\n“I understood that we\u0026rsquo;re here for service to help one another, we\u0026rsquo;re all connected. […]. Our purpose is love. [\u0026hellip;]. The love and the service is probably the most important things to learn here on this side and to transfer that to others.”\nErica Tait (\rYouTube video) :\n\u0026ldquo;Ultimately, the most important transformation was the one that led me to service, like recognizing that ultimately the highest purpose here is service and that it looks so different for each of us depending on all of our qualities and experiences and personalities but that service for love is the greatest one.\u0026rdquo;\nRaymond Moody (Life after Life) :\n“[\u0026hellip;] the being seems to stress the importance of two things in life: learning to love other people and acquiring knowledge.”\nThese experiences emphasize a simple yet radical truth: success, wealth, or power have no value in the afterlife; only the love we have given and received truly matters.\n🌍 “Earth Is a Spiritual School, and Spiritual Growth Continues After Death”\r#\rMany accounts describe earthly life as a learning stage. The soul chooses to incarnate in order to grow, experience, and evolve spiritually. Even suffering takes on meaning in this perspective, becoming an opportunity for inner transformation.\nBetty Eadie (Embraced by the Light, 1992):\n“He showed me that I had accepted this life before I was born, in order to learn specific lessons.”\nHoward Storm (My Descent Into Death) :\n“I understood that our time on earth is very brief compared to eternity, and it is given to us so that we can learn how to love, forgive and grow spiritually.”\nSome testimonies also affirm that growth does not end with death: the soul continues its evolution in other planes of existence.\nAnita Moorjani (Dying to Be Me, 2012):\n“It felt as though earth was only one dimension, one classroom in a much bigger school.”\n\u0026lt; PREVIOUS 6.3 Post-Mortem Stages NEXT 6.5 Conclusions \u0026gt; "},{"id":15,"href":"/NDE/section5/","title":"6.5 Conclusions","section":"6. Is There Anything After Death?","content":"6.5 Conclusions The books by Raymond Moody, as well as the french book \u0026ldquo;La vie après la mort – Pourquoi il faut y croire\u0026rdquo; (i.e. Life After Death – Why It Should Be Believed) by Olivier Chambon and Marie-Odile Riffard, profoundly transformed my perception of death.\nThese works led me to question the idea—deeply rooted in my traditional Christian upbringing—that death would be a final judgment, permanently sealing our fate. On the contrary, the testimonies they compile suggest that death is a transition to another plane of existence, where consciousness survives and where the soul can continue to evolve and grow spiritually.\nOne striking element of many near-death experiences is the life review: individuals relive their entire existence, often through the eyes of others—feeling the emotions they themselves caused through their words and actions. This process is not punitive. It is a profound awakening, intended to foster learning and inner transformation.\nHoward Storm’s testimony particularly moved me. He recounts that after having rejected God throughout his life, he found himself—following clinical death—immersed in a distressing darkness. And yet, God did not impose Himself upon him. He respected that refusal to the very end. But He also offered a way out: an inner voice gently encouraged him to pray. This simple act of openness changed everything—he was rescued and guided toward a light of unconditional love.\nSome accounts of negative near-death experiences describe states of suffering: isolation, anguish, darkness, sometimes even fire, pain, and dark entities. However, these trials seem less like condemnations than initiatory passages designed to provoke a radical awakening—a call to inner conversion.\nMany witnesses also report encountering a being of light, an angel, a spiritual guide, or even Jesus himself. These encounters are described as overwhelming, suffused with absolute love, and often accompanied by spiritual revelations. The main messages that recur insistently are:\nYou are deeply loved: Each person is welcomed by a divine presence (light, Jesus, God) who loves them unconditionally, without judgment or condemnation. The purpose of life is to love and to serve: Earthly life is an opportunity to learn to love others and to contribute to the common good through service. Earth is a spiritual school: Life—and even suffering—aims to help the soul evolve, and this process continues after death in other planes of existence. One striking fact stands out: none of the testimonies I have read—nor those reported in the books mentioned—emphasize doctrinal points specific to any particular religion.\nHoward Storm recounts that during his experience he was able to ask many questions to Jesus and to several angels. In his book My Descent into Death, he reports having asked, “What is the best religion?” He explains:\nI expected them to answer something like Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic, or another denomination. They replied: “the religion that brings you closer to God […] the purpose of religion is to help you have a personal relationship with God.” \u0026lt; PREVIOUS 6.4 Those Who Came Close to Death Speak: The Lessons They Received "}]
